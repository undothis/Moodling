  // Basics
  {
    category: 'basics',
    question: 'What is the tree?',
    answer: 'Your tree is a visual representation of your emotional journey. Each journal entry becomes a leaf, and patterns form branches over time.',
  },
  {
    category: 'basics',
    question: 'What are Fireflies?',
    answer: 'Fireflies are Personal wisdom—AI-generated insights written specifically for you. They reference your life: your mom, your job, your patterns. They change as your life changes.',
  },
  {
    category: 'basics',
    question: 'What are Sparks?',
    answer: 'Sparks are Universal wisdom—210+ curated prompts from a pre-written library. Like a book of quotes, they speak to universal human experience. What adapts is selection: the right Spark finds you based on your mood.',
  },
  {
    category: 'basics',
    question: 'Sparks vs Fireflies—what\'s the difference?',
    answer: 'Sparks are Universal (pre-written, for everyone), Fireflies are Personal (AI-generated, just for you). Sparks are like a book of timeless quotes; Fireflies are like a note from a friend who knows your situation.',
  },
  {
    category: 'basics',
    question: 'What are Twigs?',
    answer: 'Twigs are quick logs for when you don\'t have time for a full entry. Track mood, sleep, or energy with just a tap.',
  },

  // Guide & Adaptation
  {
    category: 'guide',
    question: 'What are Personas?',
    answer: 'Your guide has 7 nature-themed personalities: Clover (warm & casual), Spark (energetic), Willow (wise), Luna (mindful), Ridge (goal-focused), Flint (direct), and Fern (nurturing). Pick one during onboarding or change anytime in Coach Settings.',
  },
  {
    category: 'guide',
    question: 'How does my guide adapt?',
    answer: 'With Adaptive Mode on, your guide can shift personalities based on your mood (anxious → calming Luna, sad → nurturing Fern). It also adjusts energy throughout the day—more energizing in the morning, calmer at night.',
  },
  {
    category: 'guide',
    question: 'What is Chronotype?',
    answer: 'Your natural rhythm—early bird, normal, or night owl. Your guide respects this: night owls won\'t get "wind down" pressure at 10pm if that\'s their productive time. Set this during onboarding or in Coach Settings.',
  },
  {
    category: 'guide',
    question: 'What are Mood-to-Persona Switches?',
    answer: 'Automatic personality shifts based on what you\'re sharing. Feeling anxious? Your guide becomes more calming (like Luna). Feeling sad? More nurturing (like Fern). These are personalized based on your onboarding answers.',
  },
  {
    category: 'guide',
    question: 'Do Sparks adapt to my guide?',
    answer: 'Yes! Sparks match your guide\'s personality. Spark (the persona) delivers prompts with high energy, while Luna offers them contemplatively. The same creative prompt feels different based on who\'s sharing it with you.',
  },
  {
    category: 'guide',
    question: 'Can I change my chronotype over time?',
    answer: 'Yes! If you\'re a night owl wanting to become more of a morning person, your guide can help you gradually shift. It will adjust energy and encouragement to support your transition, gently nudging earlier wind-downs and celebrating morning wins.',
  },
  {
    category: 'guide',
    question: 'Does the guide help with jet lag?',
    answer: 'After travel, your guide notices when your rhythm is off and adjusts accordingly. It won\'t pressure you to be energetic when you\'re exhausted, and it can offer tips to help you readjust to your new time zone gradually.',
  },
  {
    category: 'guide',
    question: 'How does travel tracking work?',
    answer: 'During onboarding, you\'ll share how often you travel across time zones. If you travel frequently, your guide knows your rhythm may be chronically disrupted. After specific trips, it can detect jet lag and adjust for up to 2-3 weeks while you readjust.',
  },
  {
    category: 'guide',
    question: 'What gets compressed and sent to AI?',
    answer: 'Your chronotype, rhythm transitions, recent travel, and Twigs tracking are all compressed into brief summaries. Example: "Night owl transitioning to early bird, 12 days in. Meditation: 5 day streak. Morning meds: taken today." No raw journal text is sent.',
  },
  {
    category: 'guide',
    question: 'Does my guide know about my Twigs (tracking)?',
    answer: 'Yes! Your guide sees your habit streaks, medication tracking, and symptom logs. It can reference your progress ("You\'ve meditated 5 days in a row!") and offer support around your actual habits and goals.',
  },

  // Privacy
  {
    category: 'privacy',
    question: 'Is my data private?',
    answer: 'Yes! All journal entries and patterns stay on your device. Only coaching messages are sent to Claude\'s API (if enabled), and they\'re not stored.',
  },
  {
    category: 'privacy',
    question: 'What data is sent to AI?',
    answer: 'Only your current message and a compressed summary of context (not raw journal entries). This is sent encrypted to Anthropic\'s API for processing, then deleted.',
  },

  // Features
  {
    category: 'features',
    question: 'How do I change my guide\'s personality?',
    answer: 'Go to Settings > Coach Settings > Choose Persona. You can also give your guide a custom name and toggle Adaptive Mode on/off.',
  },
  {
    category: 'features',
    question: 'Can I redo the onboarding?',
    answer: 'Yes! Go to Settings > Help & FAQ > Redo Onboarding to start fresh with new preferences.',
  },

  // Calendar Integration
  {
    category: 'features',
    question: 'How does Calendar integration work?',
    answer: 'When enabled, your guide can see your upcoming events—meetings, travel, deadlines. It can offer support before a big presentation, notice when you\'re overbooked, and adapt to jet lag after trips.',
  },
  {
    category: 'features',
    question: 'What calendar info does my guide see?',
    answer: 'Event titles, times, and locations for the next 7 days. It detects travel (flights, timezone changes), important events (interviews, appointments), and your overall busyness level. Event contents/notes are not shared.',
  },
  {
    category: 'privacy',
    question: 'Is my calendar data private?',
    answer: 'Yes. Calendar data stays on your device. Only brief summaries ("interview tomorrow at 2pm") are included in AI context when you chat. You can disable calendar integration anytime in Settings.',
  },

  // Cycle & PMS Tracking
  {
    category: 'features',
    question: 'How does cycle tracking work?',
    answer: 'Enable cycle tracking in Settings to log your period and symptoms. The entire app adapts to your cycle—your guide becomes gentler, Sparks shift to soothing prompts, Fireflies offer cycle-aware wisdom, and special Twigs help you track symptoms.',
  },
  {
    category: 'features',
    question: 'How do Sparks change during PMS?',
    answer: 'During your premenstrual phase, Sparks shift to gentler, more soothing prompts. Less "push yourself" energy, more "be gentle with yourself" wisdom. The creative prompts become softer, more introspective, and acknowledge that this isn\'t the time for big challenges.',
  },
  {
    category: 'features',
    question: 'What Fireflies appear during my cycle?',
    answer: 'Fireflies become cycle-aware—offering insights like "Your anxiety often peaks around day 24, and it always passes" or "Last month you felt this way too, and a warm bath helped." Personal wisdom that connects your mood to your body\'s rhythm.',
  },
  {
    category: 'features',
    question: 'What Twigs are available for cycle tracking?',
    answer: 'Special cycle Twigs include: Period start/end, Flow level, Cramps, Bloating, Breast tenderness, Headache, Mood shifts, Cravings, Energy level, and Sleep quality. Track what matters to you and see patterns emerge over months.',
  },
  {
    category: 'features',
    question: 'How do I add cycle Twigs?',
    answer: 'In Settings > Cycle & Period, tap "Add Cycle Twigs" to enable all period-related tracking buttons at once. Or pick individual symptoms. They\'ll appear in your Twigs section ready to tap.',
  },
  {
    category: 'features',
    question: 'Does my guide know where I am in my cycle?',
    answer: 'Yes! Your guide sees your cycle phase and adapts accordingly. During PMS it\'s gentler and validates physical discomfort. During your period it acknowledges energy dips. It learns YOUR patterns—not generic averages—and meets you where you are.',
  },
  {
    category: 'features',
    question: 'What is the Quick Symptom button?',
    answer: 'When cycle tracking is enabled, a quick-access button appears on your home screen during your period. One tap to log cramps, flow, energy, or other symptoms—no navigating through menus. Toggle this in Settings > Cycle Tracking.',
  },
  {
    category: 'features',
    question: 'Can I customize which cycle features are on?',
    answer: 'Yes! In Settings > Cycle & Period, you control everything: Quick Symptom button, which Twigs appear, soothing Sparks during PMS, cycle-aware Fireflies, and how much your guide adapts. Not everyone has heavy periods—customize what\'s helpful for you.',
  },
  {
    category: 'features',
    question: 'How do I turn off cycle tracking completely?',
    answer: 'In Settings > Cycle & Period, toggle off "Cycle Tracking" at the top. This disables everything—Quick Symptom button, cycle Twigs, soothing Sparks, Fireflies, and guide adaptation. Your data is kept in case you re-enable later.',
  },
  {
    category: 'features',
    question: 'Can I get cycle reminders?',
    answer: 'Yes! Enable reminders in Settings > Cycle & Period. Get notified when your period is approaching, when PMS typically starts, or gentle reminders to log symptoms. Choose between push notifications or in-app alerts (Firefly blinks to get your attention).',
  },
  {
    category: 'features',
    question: 'How do I turn off period notifications?',
    answer: 'In Settings > Cycle Tracking > Notifications, there\'s a master on/off switch for all period-related notifications. One tap turns them all off (or back on). Keep cycle tracking enabled but silence the alerts.',
  },
  {
    category: 'features',
    question: 'What is a Firefly alert?',
    answer: 'Instead of a push notification, a Firefly can gently blink on your home screen to alert you. Tap it for cycle-related wisdom like "Your period is predicted in 2 days" or "PMS usually starts around now for you." Less intrusive than notifications.',
  },
  {
    category: 'features',
    question: 'Does cycle tracking sync with Apple Health?',
    answer: 'Yes! With HealthKit enabled, Mood Leaf reads your cycle data from Apple Health (synced from apps like Clue, Flo, or Apple\'s Cycle Tracking). It can also write your logs back. One source of truth across all your health apps.',
  },

  // Life Stages & Menopause
  {
    category: 'features',
    question: 'What life stages does the app support?',
    answer: 'Mood Leaf adapts to your current life stage: Regular Cycles (standard tracking), Perimenopause (irregular cycles, transition symptoms), Menopause (no periods, symptom focus), Post-Menopause (wellness maintenance), Pregnant (trimester tracking), and Postpartum (recovery support). Switch anytime in Settings.',
  },
  {
    category: 'features',
    question: 'How do I switch to menopause mode?',
    answer: 'Go to Settings > Cycle Tracking > Life Stage and select "Menopause" or "Perimenopause". Period tracking adjusts—no more period predictions during menopause, but you can still track symptoms like hot flashes, night sweats, and mood changes.',
  },
  {
    category: 'features',
    question: 'What symptoms can I track during perimenopause/menopause?',
    answer: 'Track hot flashes, night sweats, sleep disturbances, brain fog, mood changes, anxiety, joint pain, heart palpitations, and libido changes. Your guide understands this transition and offers extra compassion during difficult symptoms.',
  },
  {
    category: 'features',
    question: 'Does the app support pregnancy?',
    answer: 'Yes! Select "Pregnant" as your life stage and set your due date. Period tracking pauses automatically. Your guide becomes trimester-aware—understanding first trimester exhaustion, second trimester energy, and third trimester preparation.',
  },
  {
    category: 'features',
    question: 'Can I track fertility/ovulation?',
    answer: 'Yes, optionally. Enable "Track Fertility Window" in Settings > Cycle Tracking. The app highlights your predicted fertile window based on your cycle history. You can also get optional ovulation reminders. All data stays on your device.',
  },
  {
    category: 'features',
    question: 'Can I set contraception reminders?',
    answer: 'Yes! Set daily pill reminders, IUD check dates, implant renewal reminders, or ring/patch change alerts in Settings > Cycle Tracking > Contraception. Choose your reminder time and the app will notify you.',
  },

  // Personalization & Onboarding
  {
    category: 'guide',
    question: 'What personal info does onboarding ask?',
    answer: 'During setup, we ask your first name (so your guide can address you personally), your preferred pronouns (so responses feel right), and whether you experience menstrual cycles (to enable cycle-aware adaptation). All optional, all changeable later.',
  },
  {
    category: 'guide',
    question: 'Why does the app ask about pronouns?',
    answer: 'Your guide uses pronouns when reflecting back to you ("You mentioned you were feeling..."). Getting this right makes conversations feel natural and respectful. You can change this anytime in Settings.',
