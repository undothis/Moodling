### Who is Mood Leaf for?

Mood Leaf is designed for anyone who wants to:
- Process thoughts and emotions through journaling
- Have a supportive conversation partner
- Track mood patterns over time
- Build emotional self-awareness
- Complement (not replace) professional mental health care

---

## Core Philosophy

### The Mood Leaf Ethics

Mood Leaf follows strict ethical principles:

#### 1. Never Diagnose
Mood Leaf will never label you with conditions. Instead of "you have anxiety," it says "you've been mentioning feeling anxious lately."

#### 2. Tentative Language
Mood Leaf uses phrases like "it seems," "I wonder if," and "you might notice" because only YOU know your experience.

#### 3. Anti-Dependency
Mood Leaf is designed to help you NOT need it. It:
- Encourages real-world connections
- Celebrates when you solve things yourself
- Suggests stepping away when appropriate
- Builds your self-knowledge so you can be independent

#### 4. Privacy First
Your data never leaves your device. Period.

#### 5. Encourage Professional Help
For serious or persistent struggles, Mood Leaf always encourages seeking professional support.

## Your AI Guide

### Meet the Personas

Your AI guide has 7 nature-themed personalities, each with a distinct style:

| Persona | Emoji | Style | Best For |
|---------|-------|-------|----------|
| **Clover** | 🍀 | Warm, casual, relatable | Everyday check-ins, friendly chat |
| **Spark** | ✨ | Energetic, motivating, uplifting | Celebrating wins, building momentum |
| **Willow** | 🌿 | Calm, wise, reflective | Deep exploration, gaining perspective |
| **Luna** | 🌙 | Mindful, grounding, present | Anxiety, overwhelm, finding calm |
| **Ridge** | ⛰️ | Focused, goal-oriented, practical | Problem-solving, making plans |
| **Flint** | 🔥 | Direct, honest, no-nonsense | When you need straight talk |
| **Fern** | 🌱 | Gentle, soft, nurturing | Sadness, grief, needing care |

You pick your base persona during onboarding, but your guide can adapt beyond that.

### Adaptive Mode

When Adaptive Mode is on, your guide automatically adjusts to support you better:

#### Mood-to-Persona Switches
Your guide can temporarily shift personality based on what you're sharing:
- **Feeling anxious?** → More calming, grounding (like Luna)
- **Feeling sad?** → More gentle, nurturing (like Fern)
- **Feeling frustrated?** → More direct, validating (like Flint)
- **Feeling great?** → More energetic, celebratory (like Spark)

These switches are **personalized to you** based on your onboarding answers. If you said you prefer practical solutions when struggling, you'll get a more action-oriented guide instead of just comfort.

#### Time-of-Day Energy
Your guide subtly adjusts energy throughout the day:
- **Morning**: Gentle, awakening energy
- **Afternoon**: Steady, supportive energy
- **Evening**: Softening, winding-down energy
- **Night**: Calm, soothing, preparing for rest

You won't see these shifts announced—they just happen naturally.

### Chronotype Awareness

Your guide respects your natural rhythm based on whether you're an early bird, night owl, or somewhere in between:

| Your Chronotype | Morning | Evening |
|-----------------|---------|---------|
| **Early Bird** | Full energy, engaged | Winding down earlier |
| **Normal** | Gentle awakening | Gradual softening |
| **Night Owl** | Low-key, no pressure | Still engaged, wind-down when ready |

A night owl journaling at 10pm won't get "time to sleep" pressure if that's their productive time.

### Customizing Your Guide

#### Change Your Persona
Go to **Settings** > **Coach Settings** > **Choose Persona** to switch your base guide.

#### Custom Name
Give your guide a custom name that feels right to you.

#### Toggle Adaptive Mode
Turn automatic personality shifts on/off in **Settings** > **Coach Settings** > **Adaptive Mode**.

#### Detailed Settings
For fine-tuned control, access detailed settings:
- **Energy level**: Calm ↔ Energetic
- **Directness**: Gentle ↔ Direct
- **Validation style**: Heavy ↔ Light
- **Response length**: Brief ↔ Detailed
- **Therapeutic approaches**: Mindfulness, CBT, Somatic, etc.

### What Your Guide Knows

Your AI guide is like a friend who knows everything about you. It has access to **all your data** with full timestamps, so it can answer specific questions and make accurate references.

#### Complete Data Access

| Data Type | What It Knows | Example Questions It Can Answer |
|-----------|---------------|--------------------------------|
| **Tracking Logs** | Every habit, med, symptom tap with exact counts | "How many times did I exercise this month?" |
| **Journal Entries** | Recent entries with full text, dates, and moods | "What did I write about yesterday?" |
| **Lifestyle Factors** | Caffeine, alcohol, sleep, outdoor time, social time | "How much coffee have I had this week?" |
| **Social Exposure** | Anxiety levels, attempts, progress over time | "How's my social anxiety practice going?" |
| **Health Data** | Heart rate, sleep hours/quality, activity trends | "How did I sleep last night?" |
| **Life Context** | People, milestones, themes from your entire history | "When did I start therapy?" |
| **Current Date/Time** | Always knows exactly what "today" and "now" mean | "How does today compare to last week?" |

#### Timestamped Everything

Every piece of data includes timestamps so your guide can:
- Know exactly when things happened
- Calculate accurate totals ("47 times total, 8 this week")
- Make time-based comparisons ("You exercised more this month than last")
- Reference specific dates ("Your last panic attack was January 15th")

#### Example: Asking About Exercise

When you ask "How many times have I exercised?", your guide sees:

```
🏃 Exercised:
    - Today: 2 times
    - This week: 8 times
    - This month: 25 times
    - All time total: 47 times
    - Current streak: 5 days
    - Longest streak: 12 days
    - First logged: November 15, 2025
    - Last logged: Today
```

This means it can give you real answers based on your actual data, not generic responses.

#### Privacy Note

While your guide has access to all this data, it's processed entirely on your device. Only compressed summaries are sent to the AI—never your raw journal entries or personal details.

#### MoodPrint: Your Compressed Self

Imagine being able to summarize everything important about yourself — your patterns, your people, your struggles and strengths — in just a few lines. That's what **MoodPrint** does.

**What is MoodPrint?**

MoodPrint is Mood Leaf's unique way of distilling your emotional life into a compact summary that captures what matters most. Think of it like a fingerprint, but for your mood patterns and psychology.

**Why does this matter?**

Every time you chat with your AI guide, we need to give it context about you. But sending your entire journal history would be:
- Slow (lots of data to process)
- Expensive (AI costs scale with data size)
- Unnecessary (most of it isn't relevant to this moment)

MoodPrint solves this by intelligently compressing months of journaling into a dense, meaningful snapshot — like summarizing a 300-page autobiography into a single page that still captures *who you are*.

**What MoodPrint captures:**

| Your Patterns | What It Means For You |
|---------------|----------------------|
| **How you think** | Understanding your natural thinking style so your guide can meet you where you are |
| **How you connect** | How you relate to different people in your life (friends, family, partners, work) |
| **Your rhythms** | When you need extra support vs. when you naturally thrive |
| **What helps you** | The approaches and techniques that work best for YOUR mind |
| **Your growth** | How you're developing and where you're making progress |

**The magic:**

Your full profile might be thousands of words. MoodPrint compresses this down to roughly **100 carefully chosen tokens** — about 40% smaller — while keeping all the insight. Your guide knows you just as well, but conversations are faster and cost less.

**How your guide uses it:**

Instead of generic advice, your guide can:
- Know to offer extra reassurance when you're uncertain
- Check in during times you typically find hard
- Celebrate the healthy patterns you're building
- Meet you where you are emotionally

All of this happens without your private journal entries ever leaving your device. Only a small, anonymous summary goes to the AI — never your actual words.

Life Context is Mood Leaf's memory of your story. It extracts and remembers:

#### People

- Health events

#### Patterns
- Coping mechanisms (healthy and unhealthy)
- Temporal patterns (Sunday scaries, seasonal moods)
- Recurring themes

### How Life Context is Built

Life Context builds automatically from your journal entries:

1. **Keyword detection** - 600+ keywords across 30+ categories
2. **Entity extraction** - Names, ages, locations, medications
3. **Pattern recognition** - Recurring themes and behaviors
4. **Sentiment tracking** - How topics make you feel over time

### Viewing Your Life Context

Go to **Settings** > **Life Context** to see:
- Key people and relationships
- Active topics and themes
- Recent milestones
- Detected patterns

### Correcting Information

If Mood Leaf gets something wrong, just tell it in chat:
- "Actually, Sarah is my therapist, not my friend"
- "I'm not married anymore, we divorced"

The context will update based on new information.

#### Easter Eggs

Mood Leaf contains hidden Easter eggs - secret commands that unlock surprises. We won't tell you what they all are (that would spoil the fun!), but here are a few hints to get you started:

- `/hug` - A warm virtual embrace
- `/wisdom` - Words to ponder

**What are Easter eggs?**

Easter eggs are hidden features in software - a tradition dating back to 1979 when Atari programmer Warren Robinett secretly hid his name in the video game *Adventure* because Atari didn't credit developers at the time. When players found a hidden room containing "Created by Warren Robinett," the term "Easter egg" was born - named after the tradition of hiding eggs for children to find.

Since then, Easter eggs have become a beloved tradition in software. Google famously hides them in Search (try googling "do a barrel roll"). Video games, operating systems, and apps all contain hidden surprises for curious users to discover.

In Mood Leaf, we've hidden several Easter eggs as rewards for the curious. Some are silly, some are games, and some are just... nice. Try different `/` commands and see what you find. The geeky among us will appreciate the hunt.

*Hint: Numbers can be meaningful. Classics never die. Sometimes you just need to play.*

### Switching Coaches

Instantly change your coach's personality by typing their name with a `/`:

- `/flint` - 🔥 Flint: Direct, honest, no-fluff
- `/luna` - 🌙 Luna: Mindful, grounding, calm
- `/willow` - 🌿 Willow: Wise, reflective
- `/spark` - ✨ Spark: Energetic, motivating
- `/clover` - 🍀 Clover: Friendly, casual
- `/ridge` - ⛰️ Ridge: Action-oriented, practical
- `/fern` - 🌱 Fern: Gentle, nurturing
- `/random` - Surprise! Pick one randomly

Example: Type `/flint I need real talk about my job` to switch and start talking.
