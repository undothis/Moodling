## Introduction

### What is Mood Leaf?

Mood Leaf is a mental health journaling app with an AI companion that truly remembers you. Unlike generic chatbots, Mood Leaf:

- **Remembers your story** - People, events, challenges, and progress
- **Sees patterns** - Connects your mood to sleep, activity, and life events
- **Builds self-awareness** - Helps you understand yourself so you eventually don't need the app
- **Respects your privacy** - All data stays on your device

### Who is Mood Leaf for?

Mood Leaf is designed for anyone who wants to:
- Process thoughts and emotions through journaling
- Have a supportive conversation partner
- Track mood patterns over time
- Build emotional self-awareness
- Complement (not replace) professional mental health care

---

## Core Philosophy

### The Mood Leaf Ethics

Mood Leaf follows strict ethical principles:

#### 1. Never Diagnose
Mood Leaf will never label you with conditions. Instead of "you have anxiety," it says "you've been mentioning feeling anxious lately."

#### 2. Tentative Language
Mood Leaf uses phrases like "it seems," "I wonder if," and "you might notice" because only YOU know your experience.

#### 3. Anti-Dependency
Mood Leaf is designed to help you NOT need it. It:
- Encourages real-world connections
- Celebrates when you solve things yourself
- Suggests stepping away when appropriate
- Builds your self-knowledge so you can be independent

#### 4. Privacy First
Your data never leaves your device. Period.

#### 5. Encourage Professional Help
For serious or persistent struggles, Mood Leaf always encourages seeking professional support.

## AI Chat Companion

### How Chat Works

When you chat with Mood Leaf:

1. Your message is analyzed for crisis keywords (handled first)
2. Context is gathered (life context, health data, conversation history)
3. Your message + context is sent to Claude AI
4. Response is generated and displayed

### Conversation Approach

Mood Leaf follows a consistent approach:

1. **VALIDATE** - Acknowledge your feelings first
2. **EXPLORE** - Ask clarifying questions if needed
3. **SUPPORT** - Offer perspective or techniques
4. **EMPOWER** - End with something that builds your autonomy

### Different Conversation Modes

#### Venting Mode
If you say things like "I just need to vent" or "let me get this off my chest," Mood Leaf focuses purely on validation without problem-solving.

#### Advice Mode
If you ask "what should I do?" or "need advice," Mood Leaf helps explore options while still encouraging your own wisdom.

#### Processing Mode
For exploring complex feelings, Mood Leaf asks gentle questions to help you understand what you're experiencing.

- **Life Context** - Key people, events, themes from your journaling history

## Your AI Guide

### Meet the Personas

Your AI guide has 7 nature-themed personalities, each with a distinct style:

| Persona | Emoji | Style | Best For |
|---------|-------|-------|----------|
| **Clover** | 🍀 | Warm, casual, relatable | Everyday check-ins, friendly chat |
| **Spark** | ✨ | Energetic, motivating, uplifting | Celebrating wins, building momentum |
| **Willow** | 🌿 | Calm, wise, reflective | Deep exploration, gaining perspective |
| **Luna** | 🌙 | Mindful, grounding, present | Anxiety, overwhelm, finding calm |
| **Ridge** | ⛰️ | Focused, goal-oriented, practical | Problem-solving, making plans |
| **Flint** | 🔥 | Direct, honest, no-nonsense | When you need straight talk |
| **Fern** | 🌱 | Gentle, soft, nurturing | Sadness, grief, needing care |

You pick your base persona during onboarding, but your guide can adapt beyond that.

### Adaptive Mode

When Adaptive Mode is on, your guide automatically adjusts to support you better:

#### Mood-to-Persona Switches
Your guide can temporarily shift personality based on what you're sharing:
- **Feeling anxious?** → More calming, grounding (like Luna)
- **Feeling sad?** → More gentle, nurturing (like Fern)
- **Feeling frustrated?** → More direct, validating (like Flint)
- **Feeling great?** → More energetic, celebratory (like Spark)

These switches are **personalized to you** based on your onboarding answers. If you said you prefer practical solutions when struggling, you'll get a more action-oriented guide instead of just comfort.

#### Time-of-Day Energy
Your guide subtly adjusts energy throughout the day:
- **Morning**: Gentle, awakening energy
- **Afternoon**: Steady, supportive energy
- **Evening**: Softening, winding-down energy
- **Night**: Calm, soothing, preparing for rest

You won't see these shifts announced—they just happen naturally.

### Chronotype Awareness

Your guide respects your natural rhythm based on whether you're an early bird, night owl, or somewhere in between:

| Your Chronotype | Morning | Evening |
|-----------------|---------|---------|
| **Early Bird** | Full energy, engaged | Winding down earlier |
| **Normal** | Gentle awakening | Gradual softening |
| **Night Owl** | Low-key, no pressure | Still engaged, wind-down when ready |

A night owl journaling at 10pm won't get "time to sleep" pressure if that's their productive time.

### Customizing Your Guide

#### Change Your Persona
Go to **Settings** > **Coach Settings** > **Choose Persona** to switch your base guide.

#### Custom Name
Give your guide a custom name that feels right to you.

#### Toggle Adaptive Mode
Turn automatic personality shifts on/off in **Settings** > **Coach Settings** > **Adaptive Mode**.

#### Detailed Settings
For fine-tuned control, access detailed settings:
- **Energy level**: Calm ↔ Energetic
- **Directness**: Gentle ↔ Direct
- **Validation style**: Heavy ↔ Light
- **Response length**: Brief ↔ Detailed
- **Therapeutic approaches**: Mindfulness, CBT, Somatic, etc.

### What Your Guide Knows

Your AI guide is like a friend who knows everything about you. It has access to **all your data** with full timestamps, so it can answer specific questions and make accurate references.

#### Complete Data Access

| Data Type | What It Knows | Example Questions It Can Answer |
|-----------|---------------|--------------------------------|
| **Tracking Logs** | Every habit, med, symptom tap with exact counts | "How many times did I exercise this month?" |
| **Journal Entries** | Recent entries with full text, dates, and moods | "What did I write about yesterday?" |
| **Lifestyle Factors** | Caffeine, alcohol, sleep, outdoor time, social time | "How much coffee have I had this week?" |
| **Social Exposure** | Anxiety levels, attempts, progress over time | "How's my social anxiety practice going?" |
| **Health Data** | Heart rate, sleep hours/quality, activity trends | "How did I sleep last night?" |
| **Life Context** | People, milestones, themes from your entire history | "When did I start therapy?" |
| **Current Date/Time** | Always knows exactly what "today" and "now" mean | "How does today compare to last week?" |

#### Timestamped Everything

Every piece of data includes timestamps so your guide can:
- Know exactly when things happened
- Calculate accurate totals ("47 times total, 8 this week")
- Make time-based comparisons ("You exercised more this month than last")
- Reference specific dates ("Your last panic attack was January 15th")

#### Example: Asking About Exercise

When you ask "How many times have I exercised?", your guide sees:

```
🏃 Exercised:
    - Today: 2 times
    - This week: 8 times
    - This month: 25 times
    - All time total: 47 times
    - Current streak: 5 days
    - Longest streak: 12 days
    - First logged: November 15, 2025
    - Last logged: Today
```

This means it can give you real answers based on your actual data, not generic responses.

#### Privacy Note

While your guide has access to all this data, it's processed entirely on your device. Only compressed summaries are sent to the AI—never your raw journal entries or personal details.
