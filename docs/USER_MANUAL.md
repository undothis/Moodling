## Introduction

### What is Mood Leaf?

Mood Leaf is a mental health journaling app with an AI companion that truly remembers you. Unlike generic chatbots, Mood Leaf:

- **Remembers your story** - People, events, challenges, and progress
- **Sees patterns** - Connects your mood to sleep, activity, and life events
- **Builds self-awareness** - Helps you understand yourself so you eventually don't need the app
- **Respects your privacy** - All data stays on your device

### Who is Mood Leaf for?

Mood Leaf is designed for anyone who wants to:
- Process thoughts and emotions through journaling
- Have a supportive conversation partner
- Track mood patterns over time
- Build emotional self-awareness
- Complement (not replace) professional mental health care

---

## Core Philosophy

### The Mood Leaf Ethics

Mood Leaf follows strict ethical principles:

#### 1. Never Diagnose
Mood Leaf will never label you with conditions. Instead of "you have anxiety," it says "you've been mentioning feeling anxious lately."

#### 2. Tentative Language
Mood Leaf uses phrases like "it seems," "I wonder if," and "you might notice" because only YOU know your experience.

#### 3. Anti-Dependency
Mood Leaf is designed to help you NOT need it. It:
- Encourages real-world connections
- Celebrates when you solve things yourself
- Suggests stepping away when appropriate
- Builds your self-knowledge so you can be independent

#### 4. Privacy First
Your data never leaves your device. Period.

#### 5. Encourage Professional Help
For serious or persistent struggles, Mood Leaf always encourages seeking professional support.

## AI Chat Companion

### How Chat Works

2. Context is gathered (life context, health data, conversation history)
3. Your message + context is sent to Claude AI
4. Response is generated and displayed

### Conversation Approach

Mood Leaf follows a consistent approach:

1. **VALIDATE** - Acknowledge your feelings first
2. **EXPLORE** - Ask clarifying questions if needed
3. **SUPPORT** - Offer perspective or techniques
4. **EMPOWER** - End with something that builds your autonomy

### Different Conversation Modes

#### Venting Mode
If you say things like "I just need to vent" or "let me get this off my chest," Mood Leaf focuses purely on validation without problem-solving.

#### Advice Mode
If you ask "what should I do?" or "need advice," Mood Leaf helps explore options while still encouraging your own wisdom.

#### Processing Mode
For exploring complex feelings, Mood Leaf asks gentle questions to help you understand what you're experiencing.

### What Mood Leaf Knows About You

During chat, Mood Leaf has access to:

- **Life Context** - Key people, events, themes from your journaling history

## Your AI Guide

### Meet the Personas

Your AI guide has 7 nature-themed personalities, each with a distinct style:

| Persona | Emoji | Style | Best For |
|---------|-------|-------|----------|
| **Clover** | 🍀 | Warm, casual, relatable | Everyday check-ins, friendly chat |
| **Spark** | ✨ | Energetic, motivating, uplifting | Celebrating wins, building momentum |
| **Willow** | 🌿 | Calm, wise, reflective | Deep exploration, gaining perspective |
| **Luna** | 🌙 | Mindful, grounding, present | Anxiety, overwhelm, finding calm |
| **Ridge** | ⛰️ | Focused, goal-oriented, practical | Problem-solving, making plans |
| **Flint** | 🔥 | Direct, honest, no-nonsense | When you need straight talk |
| **Fern** | 🌱 | Gentle, soft, nurturing | Sadness, grief, needing care |

You pick your base persona during onboarding, but your guide can adapt beyond that.

### Adaptive Mode

When Adaptive Mode is on, your guide automatically adjusts to support you better:

#### Mood-to-Persona Switches
Your guide can temporarily shift personality based on what you're sharing:
- **Feeling anxious?** → More calming, grounding (like Luna)
- **Feeling sad?** → More gentle, nurturing (like Fern)
- **Feeling frustrated?** → More direct, validating (like Flint)
- **Feeling great?** → More energetic, celebratory (like Spark)

These switches are **personalized to you** based on your onboarding answers. If you said you prefer practical solutions when struggling, you'll get a more action-oriented guide instead of just comfort.

#### Time-of-Day Energy
Your guide subtly adjusts energy throughout the day:
- **Morning**: Gentle, awakening energy
- **Afternoon**: Steady, supportive energy
- **Evening**: Softening, winding-down energy
- **Night**: Calm, soothing, preparing for rest

You won't see these shifts announced—they just happen naturally.

### Chronotype Awareness

Your guide respects your natural rhythm based on whether you're an early bird, night owl, or somewhere in between:

| Your Chronotype | Morning | Evening |
|-----------------|---------|---------|
| **Early Bird** | Full energy, engaged | Winding down earlier |
| **Normal** | Gentle awakening | Gradual softening |
| **Night Owl** | Low-key, no pressure | Still engaged, wind-down when ready |

A night owl journaling at 10pm won't get "time to sleep" pressure if that's their productive time.

### Customizing Your Guide

#### Change Your Persona
Go to **Settings** > **Coach Settings** > **Choose Persona** to switch your base guide.

#### Custom Name
Give your guide a custom name that feels right to you.

#### Toggle Adaptive Mode
Turn automatic personality shifts on/off in **Settings** > **Coach Settings** > **Adaptive Mode**.

#### Detailed Settings
For fine-tuned control, access detailed settings:
- **Energy level**: Calm ↔ Energetic
- **Directness**: Gentle ↔ Direct
- **Validation style**: Heavy ↔ Light
- **Response length**: Brief ↔ Detailed
- **Therapeutic approaches**: Mindfulness, CBT, Somatic, etc.

### What Your Guide Knows

Your AI guide is like a friend who knows everything about you. It has access to **all your data** with full timestamps, so it can answer specific questions and make accurate references.

#### Complete Data Access

| Data Type | What It Knows | Example Questions It Can Answer |
|-----------|---------------|--------------------------------|
| **Tracking Logs** | Every habit, med, symptom tap with exact counts | "How many times did I exercise this month?" |
| **Journal Entries** | Recent entries with full text, dates, and moods | "What did I write about yesterday?" |
| **Lifestyle Factors** | Caffeine, alcohol, sleep, outdoor time, social time | "How much coffee have I had this week?" |
| **Social Exposure** | Anxiety levels, attempts, progress over time | "How's my social anxiety practice going?" |
| **Health Data** | Heart rate, sleep hours/quality, activity trends | "How did I sleep last night?" |
| **Life Context** | People, milestones, themes from your entire history | "When did I start therapy?" |
| **Current Date/Time** | Always knows exactly what "today" and "now" mean | "How does today compare to last week?" |

#### Timestamped Everything

Every piece of data includes timestamps so your guide can:
- Know exactly when things happened
- Calculate accurate totals ("47 times total, 8 this week")
- Make time-based comparisons ("You exercised more this month than last")
- Reference specific dates ("Your last panic attack was January 15th")

#### Example: Asking About Exercise

When you ask "How many times have I exercised?", your guide sees:

```
🏃 Exercised:
    - Today: 2 times
    - This week: 8 times
    - This month: 25 times
    - All time total: 47 times
    - Current streak: 5 days
    - Longest streak: 12 days
    - First logged: November 15, 2025
    - Last logged: Today
```

This means it can give you real answers based on your actual data, not generic responses.

#### Privacy Note

While your guide has access to all this data, it's processed entirely on your device. Only compressed summaries are sent to the AI—never your raw journal entries or personal details.

#### MoodPrint: Your Compressed Self

Imagine being able to summarize everything important about yourself — your patterns, your people, your struggles and strengths — in just a few lines. That's what **MoodPrint** does.

**What is MoodPrint?**

MoodPrint is Mood Leaf's unique way of distilling your emotional life into a compact summary that captures what matters most. Think of it like a fingerprint, but for your mood patterns and psychology.

**Why does this matter?**

Every time you chat with your AI guide, we need to give it context about you. But sending your entire journal history would be:
- Slow (lots of data to process)
- Expensive (AI costs scale with data size)
- Unnecessary (most of it isn't relevant to this moment)

MoodPrint solves this by intelligently compressing months of journaling into a dense, meaningful snapshot — like summarizing a 300-page autobiography into a single page that still captures *who you are*.

**What MoodPrint captures:**

| Your Patterns | What It Means For You |
|---------------|----------------------|
| **How you think** | Understanding your natural thinking style so your guide can meet you where you are |
| **How you connect** | How you relate to different people in your life (friends, family, partners, work) |
| **Your rhythms** | When you need extra support vs. when you naturally thrive |
| **What helps you** | The approaches and techniques that work best for YOUR mind |
| **Your growth** | How you're developing and where you're making progress |

**The magic:**

Your full profile might be thousands of words. MoodPrint compresses this down to roughly **100 carefully chosen tokens** — about 40% smaller — while keeping all the insight. Your guide knows you just as well, but conversations are faster and cost less.

**How your guide uses it:**

Instead of generic advice, your guide can:
- Know to offer extra reassurance when you're uncertain
- Check in during times you typically find hard
- Celebrate the healthy patterns you're building
- Meet you where you are emotionally

All of this happens without your private journal entries ever leaving your device. Only a small, anonymous summary goes to the AI — never your actual words.

## Life Context System

### What is Life Context?

Life Context is Mood Leaf's memory of your story. It extracts and remembers:

#### People
- Family (mom, dad, siblings, etc.)
- Romantic partners
- Friends
- Coworkers, bosses
- Therapists, doctors

#### Topics & Themes
- Health journey (conditions, medications, treatments)
- Work/career situation
- Financial circumstances
- Living situation
- Hobbies and interests

#### Events & Milestones
- Achievements
- Losses
- Major life changes
- Relationship events
- Health events

#### Patterns
- Coping mechanisms (healthy and unhealthy)
- Temporal patterns (Sunday scaries, seasonal moods)
- Recurring themes

### How Life Context is Built

Life Context builds automatically from your journal entries:

1. **Keyword detection** - 600+ keywords across 30+ categories
2. **Entity extraction** - Names, ages, locations, medications
3. **Pattern recognition** - Recurring themes and behaviors
4. **Sentiment tracking** - How topics make you feel over time

### Viewing Your Life Context

Go to **Settings** > **Life Context** to see:
- Key people and relationships
- Active topics and themes
- Recent milestones
- Detected patterns

### Correcting Information

If Mood Leaf gets something wrong, just tell it in chat:
- "Actually, Sarah is my therapist, not my friend"
- "I'm not married anymore, we divorced"

The context will update based on new information.

This helps you connect physical sensations to emotional experiences.

### Sleep Impact Awareness

- Doesn't make assumptions, just observations

### Activity Correlation

---

## Patterns & Insights

### Correlation Tracking

Mood Leaf tracks correlations over 90 days:

#### Sleep-Mood Correlation
- Compares mood scores on good sleep vs. poor sleep nights
- Identifies if you consistently feel better with more sleep

#### Activity-Mood Correlation
- Compares mood scores on active vs. sedentary days
- Identifies if movement improves your wellbeing

### Insight Types

Mood Leaf generates several insight types:

#### Heart Rate Check-ins
> "Your heart rate is elevated. Want to share what's going on?"

#### Sleep Acknowledgments
> "Rough night? Only 5 hours of sleep. Be gentle with yourself today."

#### Activity Suggestions
> "You've been still today. A short walk might help shift things."

#### Pattern Discoveries
> "Looking at your data, you tend to feel better on days after good sleep."

### How Insights Are Used

Insights can:
1. Appear as popup notifications
2. Be referenced in chat conversations
3. Help you see your own patterns
4. Build self-awareness over time

---

## Seeds Tab

The Seeds tab is where you discover patterns about yourself. We call them "seeds" because insights grow stronger over time, just like plants.

### Finding the Seeds Tab

Look for the 🌰 or 🌱 icon in the bottom navigation bar (between Skills and Insights). When new patterns are discovered, you'll see a glowing green badge.

### Growth Stages

Each insight has a growth stage showing how established the pattern is:

| Stage | Icon | What It Means |
|-------|------|---------------|
| Sprouting | 🌰 | Just noticed this pattern - needs more data |
| Growing | 🌱 | Pattern is becoming clearer |
| Flourishing | 🌿 | Strong, consistent pattern |
| Rooted | 🌳 | Core understanding about yourself |

### Pattern Categories

Seeds can discover many types of patterns:

- **🌊 Cycles** - Recurring patterns (weekly mood dips, monthly rhythms)
- **🔗 Connections** - How things relate (sleep → mood, food → energy)
- **💪 Activities** - What activities help or hurt
- **🌙 Sleep** - Sleep patterns affecting your wellbeing
- **🌅 Time** - When you feel best during the day
- **🏔 Environment** - How places affect your mood
- **🌀 Momentum** - Streak effects and habits
- **🌧 Triggers** - What triggers certain moods
- **💫 Recovery** - What helps you bounce back
- **🦋 Body-Mind** - Physical-emotional connections
- **🌱 Growth** - Your progress over time
- **⚠️ Warnings** - Early warning signs

### Responding to Seeds

You can react to any insight:
- **🌱 "This resonates"** - The pattern feels accurate
- **🤔 "I'll watch for this"** - You're curious to observe
- **🍂 "Not quite right"** - Doesn't match your experience

Your reactions help Mood Leaf learn what insights are meaningful to you. When you mark an insight as "Not quite right," Mood Leaf will:
- Lower the priority of that insight
- Stop mentioning it in conversations
- Re-evaluate the pattern with future data

### Data Sources for Pattern Discovery

Mood Leaf can analyze data from multiple sources to find patterns. Here's exactly what each source provides:

| Data Source | What's Analyzed | Example Insights |
|-------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Twigs (Mood Logs)** | Mood ratings, notes, tags, timestamps | "You feel better on days you journal" |
| **Coach Conversations** | Topics discussed, themes, concerns | "Work stress comes up often on Mondays" |
| **Calendar Events** | Meeting frequency, event types, scheduling | "Back-to-back meetings correlate with anxiety" |
| **Contacts** | Social interaction frequency (not content) | "Mood improves after family calls" |
| **Location** | Places visited, time spent outdoors | "You feel calmer after park visits" |
| **Screen Time** | App usage patterns, phone pickups | "Late-night scrolling affects next-day mood" |
| **Health Data** | Sleep, steps, heart rate, exercise | "Less than 6 hours sleep → harder days" |
| **Weather** | Temperature, conditions, sunlight | "Cloudy days correlate with lower energy" |

**Important Privacy Notes:**
- All pattern analysis runs **locally on your device** by default
- No data is sent to external servers for analysis
- Each data source requires **explicit permission** before use
- You can disable any source at any time in Settings > Privacy
- Disabling a source removes it from future analysis (existing insights remain)

#### Easter Eggs

Mood Leaf contains hidden Easter eggs - secret commands that unlock surprises. We won't tell you what they all are (that would spoil the fun!), but here are a few hints to get you started:

- `/hug` - A warm virtual embrace
- `/wisdom` - Words to ponder

**What are Easter eggs?**

Easter eggs are hidden features in software - a tradition dating back to 1979 when Atari programmer Warren Robinett secretly hid his name in the video game *Adventure* because Atari didn't credit developers at the time. When players found a hidden room containing "Created by Warren Robinett," the term "Easter egg" was born - named after the tradition of hiding eggs for children to find.

Since then, Easter eggs have become a beloved tradition in software. Google famously hides them in Search (try googling "do a barrel roll"). Video games, operating systems, and apps all contain hidden surprises for curious users to discover.

In Mood Leaf, we've hidden several Easter eggs as rewards for the curious. Some are silly, some are games, and some are just... nice. Try different `/` commands and see what you find. The geeky among us will appreciate the hunt.

*Hint: Numbers can be meaningful. Classics never die. Sometimes you just need to play.*

### Switching Coaches

- `/flint` - 🔥 Flint: Direct, honest, no-fluff
- `/luna` - 🌙 Luna: Mindful, grounding, calm
- `/willow` - 🌿 Willow: Wise, reflective
- `/spark` - ✨ Spark: Energetic, motivating
- `/clover` - 🍀 Clover: Friendly, casual
- `/ridge` - ⛰️ Ridge: Action-oriented, practical

## AI Accountability Features

Mood Leaf's AI can help hold you accountable by automatically creating trackers, reminders, and alerts based on your conversations. The accountability system is designed to be **supportive, not preachy** - it adapts to your comfort level and respects your autonomy.

### How It Works

When you mention goals or habits in conversation, the AI can offer to:

1. **Create Twigs (Quick Logs)** - Track habits you want to build or break
2. **Create Calendar Events** - Set reminders in your phone's calendar
3. **Create Contacts** - Save people to your address book
4. **Set Limit Alerts** - Get notified when you're approaching or exceeding limits
5. **Drink Pacing** - Help pace drinking at social events with timed reminders

### Example Conversations

**Setting a Limit:**
> You: "I want to limit my coffee to 4 cups a day"
> AI: "I can help you track that! Want me to create a Coffee tracker with a limit of 4 per day? I'll alert you when you're approaching your limit."

**Building a Habit:**
> You: "I should really start meditating"
> AI: "Would you like me to create a Meditation Twig so you can track your progress? I can also set a daily reminder."

**Breaking a Habit:**
> You: "I need to spend less time on my computer"
> AI: "I can create a 'Computer Time' tracker to help you stay aware. Want me to set that up?"

**Creating Reminders:**
> You: "Remind me to call mom every Sunday at 2pm"
> AI: "I'll add that to your calendar! Would you like it as a recurring weekly event?"

**Saving Contacts:**
> You: "I met a new therapist, Dr. Smith, her number is 555-1234"
> AI: "Should I save Dr. Smith to your contacts?"

### Limit-Based Alerts

When you set limits (like "max 4 coffees"), the AI tracks your usage and alerts you:

| Status | Example Alert |
|--------|---------------|
| **Approaching** | "Heads up: You're at 3/4 coffees today. 1 left if you want to stay on track." |
| **Reached** | "You've reached your coffee limit for today. Nice awareness!" |
| **Exceeded** | "That's 5 coffees today - 1 over your goal. No judgment, just data." |

Alerts are supportive, not judgmental. The language follows MoodLeaf's "warm honesty" philosophy.

### Permissions

To use these features, Mood Leaf needs permissions:

| Feature | Permission Needed |
|---------|-------------------|
| Twigs | None (stored locally) |
| Calendar Events | Calendar access |
| Contacts | Contacts access |
| Limit Alerts | Notifications |

You'll be asked for permissions when you first use each feature.

### What the AI Can Create

**Twigs (Quick Logs):**
- Habit building (want MORE of this)
- Habit breaking (want LESS of this)
- Goals with deadlines
- Symptoms to track
- Medication reminders
- Custom tracking

**Calendar Events:**
- One-time reminders
- Recurring events (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Appointment reminders
- Deadline alerts

**Contacts:**
- Name and phone number
- Email address
- Notes about the person

### Viewing AI-Created Items

To see what the AI has created for you:
- **Twigs**: Home screen > Quick Logs section
- **Calendar**: Your phone's Calendar app (look for "MoodLeaf" calendar)
- **Contacts**: Your phone's Contacts app
- **Limit Alerts**: Settings > Accountability > Active Limits

### Tips for Best Results

1. **Be specific**: "Max 3 coffees" works better than "less coffee"
2. **Include times**: "Remind me at 9am" creates better reminders
3. **Confirm when asked**: The AI will always ask before creating anything
4. **Review regularly**: Check your Twigs to see your progress

### Drink Pacing (Harm Reduction Tool)

The Drink Pacing feature helps you pace your alcohol consumption at social events. This is a **harm reduction tool** - not promoting drinking, but helping those who choose to drink do so more mindfully.

**How to Start a Session:**
1. Open Skills → find "Drink Pacing" or say "I want to pace my drinking tonight"
2. Set your interval (how often to be reminded, e.g., every 60 minutes)
3. Set your max drinks (optional limit)
4. Name your event (optional, e.g., "Sarah's party")
5. Tap "Start Pacing"

**During Your Session:**
- Your phone will vibrate when it's time for your next drink
- Tap "Log a Drink" each time you have one
- See your running count: "2/4 drinks"
- Get alerts when approaching or reaching your limit

**Features:**
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Silent Mode** | Vibration only - no sounds (discreet for social settings) |
| **Smart Timing** | Minimum 15-minute intervals for safety |
| **Limit Tracking** | Visual progress: "2/4 drinks" |
| **Auto-End** | Session auto-ends after 6 hours |
| **History** | Track your patterns over time |

**Example Session:**
> You: "I'm going to a party tonight and want to stick to 3 drinks max"
> Coach: "Got it! I can set up drink pacing - one drink every hour, max 3. I'll buzz your phone when it's time. Want me to start the session?"

**Ending Your Session:**
Tap "End Session" to see your summary:
- Total drinks consumed
- Duration of session
- Whether you stayed on pace

### Adaptive Accountability

The accountability system adapts to your preferences. You're in control of how much (or how little) the coach mentions your limits.

**Intensity Levels:**

| Level | How It Works |
|-------|--------------|
| **Off** | Coach never mentions limits or accountability |
| **Gentle** | Only mentions if you significantly exceed limits, very softly |
| **Moderate** | Normal check-ins when approaching/reaching limits |
| **Proactive** | Active check-ins, encouragement, and progress updates |

**Adjusting On-the-Fly:**

You can change accountability intensity in conversation:
- "Stop reminding me about coffee" → Pauses coffee reminders
- "Don't hold me accountable today" → Pauses all accountability for today
- "Be more strict with me" → Increases accountability intensity
- "Back off a bit" → Decreases accountability intensity

**Comfort Check-ins:**

Periodically, the coach may ask:
> "How's the accountability feeling? Too much? Too little? Just right?"

This helps the system learn your preferences over time.

**Pause Feature:**

Say "Pause accountability for today" to:
- Stop all limit reminders until midnight
- Coach won't mention any tracked items
- Everything resumes automatically the next day

### Privacy Note

- Twigs and their entries are stored locally
