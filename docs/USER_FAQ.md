## Getting Started

### What is Moodling?

Moodling is a mental health journaling app with an AI companion. It helps you:
- Journal your thoughts and feelings
- Chat with an empathetic AI that remembers your story
- See patterns and correlations in your mood, sleep, and activity
- Build self-awareness so you can eventually not need the app

### Is Moodling a replacement for therapy?

**No.** Moodling is a journaling companion, not a therapist. It will never:
- Diagnose you with any condition
- Tell you to change medications
- Replace professional mental health care

If you're struggling, Moodling will encourage you to seek professional help.

### How do I set up my API key?

Moodling uses Claude AI, which requires an API key:
1. Go to **Settings** > **API Key**
2. Get a key from [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com)
3. Paste your key and save

Your key stays on your device and is never shared.

### How much does it cost to use?

Moodling itself is free. API usage costs depend on how much you chat:
- Light usage: ~$0.50-1/month
- Regular usage: ~$2-5/month
- You can track costs in **Settings** > **Usage**

---

## Moodling's Code of Conduct

### What are Moodling's ethical principles?

Moodling follows a strict code of conduct called the **Moodling Ethics**:

#### 1. Never Diagnose
Moodling will **never** label you with mental health conditions. Instead of saying "you have anxiety disorder," it says "you've been mentioning feeling anxious lately." Only qualified professionals can diagnose.

#### 2. Never Prescribe
Moodling will **never** tell you to start, stop, or change medications. It might acknowledge you're taking something, but medication decisions are between you and your doctor.

#### 3. Always Tentative
Moodling uses language like "it seems," "I wonder if," and "you might notice" because only YOU truly know your experience. We never tell you how you feel.

#### 4. Anti-Dependency
Moodling is designed to help you **not need it**. We actively encourage:
- Real-world connections over app conversations
- Building your own coping skills
- Trusting your own wisdom
- Stepping away when appropriate

#### 5. Privacy First
Your data belongs to you. Everything stays on your device. We can't see your journals, and we don't want to.

#### 6. Encourage Professional Help
For persistent struggles, Moodling always encourages seeking professional support. We're a companion, not a replacement for therapy.

#### 7. Honest & Grounded
Moodling won't give you toxic positivity or empty reassurance. It's honest, grounded, and meets you where you are.

### Why does Moodling have these rules?

Mental health apps can cause harm if they're not careful. We've seen apps that:
- Create unhealthy dependency
- Give dangerous advice
- Make people feel judged
- Violate privacy

Moodling's ethics exist to make sure we help, never harm.

### What if Moodling breaks these rules?

If you ever feel Moodling violated these principles, please let us know. You can shake the device to report feedback, or email us. We take ethics seriously.

## How Moodling Learns

### Does Moodling get better the more I use it?

**Yes!** The more you use Moodling, the better it understands you:

#### Week 1
- Learns your name and basic situation
- Starts detecting key people you mention
- Notices your communication preferences

#### Month 1
- Knows key relationships (partner, family, friends, therapist)
- Understands your work/school situation
- Tracks health journey and medications
- Learns what topics matter to you

#### Month 3+
- Sees long-term patterns in your mood
- Knows your coping mechanisms (healthy and unhealthy)
- Understands seasonal/temporal patterns
- Can reference things from months ago

#### With HealthKit (optional)
- Correlates sleep with mood over time
- Notices activity patterns
- Learns your heart rate baseline
- Discovers YOUR personal patterns

### How does Moodling remember things?

Moodling builds a **Life Context** from your journal entries:

1. **Automatic extraction** - Detects people, events, health info, work situations
2. **Pattern recognition** - Notices recurring themes over time
3. **Milestone tracking** - Remembers significant events
4. **Sentiment tracking** - Knows how topics make you feel

This context is stored **only on your device** and used to give you personalized responses.

### What does "personalized" actually mean?

Compare these responses:

**Generic chatbot:**
> "That sounds stressful. Have you tried deep breathing?"

**Moodling after learning about you:**
> "Work stress again - that's the third time this week you've mentioned your manager. Last time, you said talking to Sarah helped. Have you been able to connect with her?"

The more context Moodling has, the more it can reference YOUR story, YOUR people, and YOUR patterns.

### Can I see what Moodling knows about me?

Yes! Go to **Settings** > **Life Context** to see:
- People Moodling has detected
- Topics and themes tracked
- Milestones and events
- Health information
- Patterns identified

You can clear this anytime.

### Does using the app more cost more?

Using the app more means:
- More journal entries (free - stored locally)
- More chat messages (costs API tokens)
- Better context (makes responses more relevant)

Typical costs remain low ($2-5/month for regular users) because Moodling sends compressed context, not full journal history.

---

## Journaling

### How do I create a journal entry?

1. Tap the **+** button on the home screen
2. Write your thoughts (text or voice)
3. Tap **Save**

That's it! Moodling will automatically detect the mood and themes.

### Can I use voice to journal?

Yes! Tap the microphone icon to speak your entry. Moodling will transcribe it for you.

### What does Moodling do with my journal entries?

Moodling:
- Stores entries **only on your device**
- Extracts themes and topics to remember your story
- Detects mood to track patterns over time
- Uses context to give you better responses when chatting

Moodling does **not**:
- Send your full entries to any server
- Share your data with anyone
- Use your entries to train AI models

### Can I edit or delete entries?

Yes. Tap any entry to view it, then use **Edit** or **Delete**.

### What are "significant" entries?

Moodling marks entries as significant when they contain important life context like:
- Relationships (partner, family, friends)
- Work/career events
- Health mentions
- Milestones and achievements
- Challenges you're facing

This helps Moodling remember what matters to you.

---

## Chatting with Moodling

### How does Moodling remember things about me?

Moodling builds a **Life Context** from your journal entries over time:
- Key people in your life (partner, therapist, boss, etc.)
- Important events and milestones
- Health journey and medications
- Work situation and challenges
- Hobbies and interests
- Your communication preferences

This lets Moodling give responses that understand YOUR story, not generic advice.

### Why does Moodling use tentative language?

You'll notice Moodling says things like "it seems like" or "I wonder if" rather than definitive statements. This is intentional because:
- Only YOU know your experience
- We don't want to tell you how you feel
- It leaves room for you to correct or clarify

### Can I ask Moodling for advice?

Yes, but Moodling will:
- Help you explore options rather than tell you what to do
- Ask what your gut says
- Encourage you to trust your own wisdom
- Suggest professional help for serious decisions

### What if I just want to vent?

That's totally fine! Just start venting. Moodling will focus on validation and listening rather than problem-solving. You can say "I just need to vent" to make it clear.

### Why does Moodling sometimes suggest stepping away?

Moodling is designed to help you build independence, not dependency. If you've been chatting a while, it might gently suggest:
- Taking a break
- Journaling instead
- Talking to someone in real life
- Trusting your own wisdom

This is a feature, not a bug!

### How do I talk about a specific journal entry?

From the entry detail screen, tap **"Talk about this"**. Moodling will have context about that entry in the chat.

---

## Privacy & Data

### Where is my data stored?

**Everything stays on your device.** Moodling uses local storage (AsyncStorage on iOS) which means:

- Your journal entries are saved in your phone's app storage
- Your life context is built and stored locally
- Your chat history lives only on your device
- Your health data (if enabled) is cached locally
- Your settings and preferences are local

**We have no servers.** We literally cannot see your data because it never leaves your phone.

### What exactly is stored on my device?

| Data Type | What's Stored | Where |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| Journal entries | Full text, mood, topics, timestamps | Local storage |
| Life context | Extracted people, events, patterns | Local storage |
| Chat history | Your messages and AI responses | Local storage |
| Health data | Cached HealthKit snapshots | Local storage |
| Correlations | 90 days of mood + health data | Local storage |
| API key | Your Anthropic key (encrypted) | Secure storage |
| Preferences | Tone, notifications, settings | Local storage |

### What happens if I delete the app?

If you delete Moodling:
- **All data is permanently deleted** from your device
- There's no backup unless you exported first
- We have no copy to restore

**Recommendation:** Use **Export Data** before deleting if you want to keep your history.

### Does Moodling send my data to AI servers?

When you chat, Moodling sends:
- Your current message
- Recent chat history (last ~6 messages)
- A **compressed summary** of your life context (not raw journal entries)
- Current health snapshot (if HealthKit enabled)

**What we DON'T send:**
- Full text of all your journal entries
- Your complete chat history
- Raw health data dumps
- Any identifying information beyond what you type

### How is data sent securely?

All communication with Claude API uses:
- HTTPS encryption in transit
- Direct connection to Anthropic's servers
- No intermediary servers or proxies
- No logging on our end (we have no servers)

### What does Anthropic do with my data?

According to Anthropic's privacy policy:
- API data is **not used for training** AI models
- Data is encrypted at rest
- Data is deleted after processing
- They don't sell or share your data

### Can I export my data?

Yes. Go to **Settings** > **Export Data** to download:
- All journal entries (with metadata)
- Complete chat history
- Life context data
- Health correlation data
- Settings and preferences

Export format is JSON, readable by any text editor.

### Can I delete all my data?

Yes. Go to **Settings** > **Delete All Data**. This:
- Permanently removes everything from your device
- Clears all local storage
- Cannot be undone
- Takes effect immediately

### What is Secure Delete?

For extra peace of mind, Moodling offers **Secure Delete**:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Privacy** > **Secure Delete**
2. Enter the confirmation code shown
3. Tap **Permanently Delete**

Secure Delete:
- **Overwrites data multiple times** before deletion (3 passes)
- **Verifies** all data has been removed
- **Checks for remnants** and removes any stray data
- **Provides a report** confirming deletion

This makes data recovery virtually impossible, even with forensic tools.

### Can I delete just some of my data?

Yes. You can selectively delete:
- **Journal entries** - Settings > Privacy > Delete Journal Data
- **Chat history** - Settings > Privacy > Delete Chat History
- **Health data** - Settings > Privacy > Delete Health Data
- **Life context** - Settings > Life Context > Clear
- **Strategy favorites** - Strategies > Favorites > Clear All

Each deletion uses the same secure overwrite process.

### Is my API key secure?

Your API key is:
- Stored in iOS Secure Storage (Keychain)
- Never logged or displayed after entry
- Only sent directly to Anthropic's API
- Never shared with us or anyone else

### What if my phone is lost or stolen?

- If your phone has a passcode, your data is encrypted
- Moodling has no remote access to wipe data
- Use Find My iPhone to remotely wipe if needed
- Consider enabling Face ID / Touch ID for extra security

### Can someone else access my Moodling data?

Only if they:
1. Have physical access to your unlocked phone
2. Open the Moodling app

Consider using iOS Screen Time to add an app-specific passcode if this concerns you.

## HealthKit Integration

### What health data does Moodling use?

If you enable HealthKit, Moodling can access:
- **Heart rate** - Current, resting, and variability
- **Sleep** - Duration, quality, and patterns
- **Activity** - Steps, exercise minutes, active calories

### Why would I connect HealthKit?

Connecting HealthKit allows Moodling to:
- Notice when your heart rate spikes (stress indicator)
- Acknowledge poor sleep might affect your mood
- Point out patterns ("you feel better on active days")
- Send gentle check-ins when your body signals stress

### How does heart rate monitoring work?

When your heart rate spikes significantly above your baseline:
1. Your phone buzzes with a gentle notification
2. The notification asks "What's going on?"
3. You can tap to journal about it
4. This helps you connect physical sensations to emotions

Notifications are rate-limited (max 1 per 30 minutes) to avoid being annoying.

### Does Moodling diagnose health issues?

**Never.** Moodling only describes what it observes:
- "Your heart rate is elevated" (not "you're having a panic attack")
- "You got limited sleep" (not "you have insomnia")
- "You've been less active" (not "you're depressed")

For health concerns, always consult a doctor.

### Can I disable HealthKit?

Yes. Go to **Settings** > **HealthKit** > **Disable**. Moodling works fine without it.

---

## Notifications & Insights

### What notifications will I get?

Moodling can send:
- **Heart rate spike check-ins** - "Your heart rate is up. Want to share what's happening?"
- **Sleep acknowledgments** - "Rough night? Be gentle with yourself today."
- **Pattern insights** - "You tend to feel better after good sleep."
- **Gentle activity suggestions** - "You've been still today. A short walk might help."

### Can I turn off notifications?

Yes. Go to **Settings** > **Notifications** to customize what you receive.

### What are "correlation insights"?

Over time, Moodling tracks patterns between:
- Sleep quality and mood
- Physical activity and mood
- Heart rate and anxiety mentions

When it finds patterns (backed by YOUR data), it shares them:
> "Looking at your data, you tend to feel better on days after good sleep."

This builds your self-knowledge so you can make your own decisions.

### Why does Moodling show me my patterns?

The goal is to help you understand yourself better so you eventually don't need the app. When you know that sleep affects your mood, you can prioritize sleep yourself.

## Oblique Strategies

### What are Oblique Strategies?

Inspired by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt's famous creative cards, Moodling includes its own set of **Oblique Strategies** - unexpected prompts and perspectives to shift your thinking when you're stuck.

Unlike the original (designed for musicians), Moodling's strategies are adapted for emotional wellbeing, creativity, and everyday life.

### What categories are available?

Moodling offers strategies for different situations:

- **Depression** - Gentle nudges when everything feels heavy
- **Anxiety** - Grounding prompts when your mind is racing
- **Walking** - Contemplations for when you're in motion
- **For Artists** - Creative unblocking for visual creators
- **For Musicians** - Prompts for sonic exploration
- **Funny** - Absurdist humor to break the spell
- **Strange** - Weird perspectives to jar you loose
- **Random** - Pull from any category

### How do I use them?

1. Go to **Strategies** in the app
2. Choose a category or tap **Random**
3. Read the strategy card
4. Sit with it - don't dismiss too quickly
5. Tap for another if needed

### Can you give me some examples?

**Depression:**
> "What would you do if you felt 10% better? Do that thing anyway."

> "Your brain is lying to you. It's very convincing, but it's still lying."

**Anxiety:**
> "Name five things you can see. You're here, not there."

> "The worst case scenario you're imagining - when has that actually happened?"

**Walking:**
> "Walk as if you're not trying to get anywhere."

> "Find something beautiful that no one else has noticed today."

**For Artists:**
> "Make the mistake on purpose."

> "What would this look like if you made it for a child? For an alien?"

**For Musicians:**
> "What's the note you're afraid to play?"

> "Remove the thing you think is essential."

**Funny:**
> "Have you tried being a completely different person?"

> "What if this problem belongs to someone else and you just found it?"

**Strange:**
> "You are a ghost who forgot they died. What unfinished business brought you here?"

> "Describe your current situation as a nature documentary narrator would."

### Can I save my favorite strategies?

Yes! Tap the heart icon to save a strategy. Access saved strategies in **Strategies** > **Favorites**.

### Can I suggest new strategies?

We'd love that! Shake the device to send feedback, or email us with your suggestions.

---

## Personalization

### How do I change Moodling's tone?

Go to **Settings** > **Tone Preferences**. You can choose:
- **Warm & nurturing** - Gentle, supportive
- **Direct & practical** - Straightforward, solution-focused
- **Thoughtful & reflective** - Deep, contemplative
- **Encouraging & uplifting** - Positive, motivating

Mix and match to get your ideal communication style.

### Can Moodling remember my preferences?

Yes! If you tell Moodling things like:
- "I prefer direct feedback"
- "Don't sugarcoat things"
- "I just need validation, not advice"

It will remember and adjust its responses.

### How do I correct wrong information?

Just tell Moodling in chat:
- "Actually, Sarah is my sister, not my friend"
- "I quit that job last month"

The life context will update based on new information.

## How Your Guide Adapts

Your AI guide adapts to you in several ways. Here are the key terms:

### What are Personas?

**Personas** are the 7 nature-themed personalities your guide can embody:

| Persona | Emoji | Style |
|---------|-------|-------|
| **Clover** | 🍀 | Your lucky friend - warm, casual, relatable |
| **Spark** | ✨ | Your cheerleader - energetic, motivating |
| **Willow** | 🌿 | The sage - calm, wise, reflective |
| **Luna** | 🌙 | The mystic - mindful, grounding, present |
| **Ridge** | ⛰️ | The coach - focused, goal-oriented |
| **Flint** | 🔥 | The straight shooter - direct, honest |
| **Fern** | 🌱 | The nurturer - gentle, soft, caring |

You pick your base persona during onboarding, but your guide can adapt beyond that.

### What are Mood-to-Persona Switches?

**Mood-to-Persona Switches** are automatic personality shifts based on how you're feeling.

When you share something anxious, sad, angry, or happy, your guide can temporarily switch to a persona better suited to support you in that moment:

- **Feeling anxious?** → Your guide might become more like Luna (calm, grounding)
- **Feeling sad?** → Your guide might become more like Fern (gentle, nurturing)
- **Feeling frustrated?** → Your guide might become more like Flint (direct, validating)
- **Feeling great?** → Your guide might become more like Spark (matching your energy)

**These switches are personalized to you** based on your onboarding answers:
- If you said you prefer "practical solutions" when struggling, you'll get Ridge (action-oriented) instead of Luna when anxious
- If you said you prefer "gentle" communication, you won't get Flint when you're upset

You can enable or disable this in **Settings** > **Coach Settings** > **Adaptive Mode**.

### What is Chronotype Awareness?

**Chronotype** is your natural sleep/wake rhythm - whether you're an early bird, night owl, or somewhere in between.

Your guide respects your chronotype when adjusting energy throughout the day:

| If you're a... | Morning | Evening | Night |
|----------------|---------|---------|-------|
| **Early Bird** | Full energy, engaged | Winding down | Deep calm |
| **Normal** | Gentle awakening | Softening | Calm |
| **Night Owl** | Low-key, no pressure | Still engaged | Gentle wind-down when ready |

**Why this matters**: A night owl journaling at 10pm won't get "time to wind down" pressure if that's their productive time. The guide matches YOUR rhythm.

You set this during onboarding with the question "When are you most yourself?"

### What is Time-of-Day Energy Modulation?

**Time-of-Day Energy Modulation** is how your guide subtly shifts energy throughout the day:

- **Morning**: Gentle, awakening energy to start your day
- **Afternoon**: Steady, supportive energy
- **Evening**: Softening energy, helping you wind down
- **Night**: Calm, soothing energy to prepare for rest

You won't see these shifts announced - they just happen naturally. Combined with chronotype awareness, the guide feels like it "just gets" your daily rhythm.

### What is Adaptive Mode?

**Adaptive Mode** is the setting that enables all these automatic adjustments. When on, your guide:

1. Detects mood from what you're sharing
2. Switches personas when helpful (mood-to-persona switches)
3. Adjusts energy based on time of day
4. Respects your chronotype

When off, your guide stays as your chosen base persona all the time.

**Enable/disable**: Settings > Coach Settings > Adaptive Mode

### Can I change my chronotype over time?

Yes! If you're a night owl wanting to become more of a morning person, your guide can help you gradually shift. It will adjust energy and encouragement to support your transition, gently nudging earlier wind-downs and celebrating morning wins.

### Does the guide help with jet lag or travel?

After travel, your guide notices when your rhythm is off and adjusts accordingly. It won't pressure you to be energetic when you're exhausted, and it can offer tips to help you readjust to your new time zone gradually. The guide understands that travel disrupts sleep patterns and adapts its energy and expectations to support your body's natural recalibration.

### How does my guide know what I need?

Your guide combines several signals:

1. **Your onboarding answers** - What kind of support helps you most
2. **Mood detection** - Keywords and body-awareness phrases you use (like "chest tight" or "weight on shoulders")
3. **Time of day** - Current time + your chronotype
4. **Your psychological patterns** - Noticed over time from your journals (cognitive patterns, attachment style)
5. **Your life context** - Facts, events, and people from your story
6. **Travel & rhythm disruption** - Notices when your sleep patterns are off

All of this creates a personalized experience where the guide adapts to you without you having to ask.

## Crisis Support

### What happens if I mention self-harm or suicide?

If you express thoughts of self-harm or suicide, Moodling will immediately:
1. Acknowledge what you shared
2. Provide crisis resources:
   - **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline** (call or text)
   - **Crisis Text Line** (text HOME to 741741)
   - International resources

This response comes before any AI processing to ensure you get help fast.

### Does Moodling report me to anyone?

**No.** Moodling does not contact anyone, report to authorities, or share your information. All crisis resources are provided for YOU to use if you choose.

### Is Moodling appropriate for serious mental health issues?

Moodling can be a helpful companion alongside professional treatment, but it's **not a replacement** for:
- Therapy
- Psychiatric care
- Crisis intervention
- Medical treatment

If you're struggling significantly, please reach out to a mental health professional.
