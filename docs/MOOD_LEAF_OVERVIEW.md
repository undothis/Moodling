**Your Companion for Emotional Wellness and Self-Discovery**

---

## Welcome to Mood Leaf

Mood Leaf is a mental health journaling app with an AI companion that truly remembers you. Unlike generic chatbots that forget you between conversations, Mood Leaf builds a living understanding of who you are—your relationships, your patterns, your health, your story—and uses it to support you in a way no other app can.

**What makes Mood Leaf different?**
- Your AI companion remembers your story over months and years
- It connects your mood to your sleep, activity, and life events
- It adapts its personality to what you need in the moment
- It's designed to help you NOT need it over time
- All your data stays on your device—we can't see it

## Core Philosophy

### The Mood Leaf Ethics

Mood Leaf follows strict ethical principles that guide everything we do:

#### 1. Never Diagnose
We will **never** label you with mental health conditions. Instead of "you have anxiety disorder," we say "you've been mentioning feeling anxious lately." Only qualified professionals can diagnose—we're not that.

#### 2. Never Prescribe
We will **never** tell you to start, stop, or change medications. Those decisions are between you and your doctor.

#### 3. Always Tentative
We use language like "it seems," "I wonder if," and "you might notice" because only YOU truly know your experience. We never tell you how you feel.

#### 4. Anti-Dependency
Mood Leaf is designed to help you **not need it**. We actively encourage:
- Real-world connections over app conversations
- Building your own coping skills
- Trusting your own wisdom
- Stepping away when appropriate

Our success is when you say "I don't need this app anymore."

#### 5. Privacy First
Everything stays on your device. We have no servers. We literally cannot see your data.

#### 6. Encourage Professional Help
For persistent struggles, we always encourage seeking professional support. We're a companion, not a replacement for therapy.

## Journaling (Leaves)

### The Leaf Philosophy

In Mood Leaf, journal entries are called **Leaves**. Like leaves on a tree, they're meant to be released—noticed, acknowledged, and let go.

**Journaling is noticing, not archiving.**

A leaf is a single thought, word, or feeling:
- Short, not long
- Released, not saved
- Let go, not held onto

This protects you from the trap of endless reviewing and rumination.

### Creating Entries

#### Text Entry
1. Tap the **+** button on the home screen
2. Write your thoughts
3. Tap **Save**

#### Voice Entry
1. Tap the **+** button
2. Tap the **microphone icon**
3. Speak your entry
4. Review and edit if needed
5. Tap **Save**

### What Happens When You Save

When you save a leaf, Mood Leaf automatically:
- **Detects mood** - Positive, negative, or neutral with intensity
- **Extracts topics** - People, events, themes you mentioned
- **Updates your Tree** - Adds to your life context for better conversations
- **Finds significance** - Marks important entries that contain life context

### Entry Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Mood Detection** | Color-coded (green = positive, red = negative, gray = neutral) |
| **Topic Tags** | People, emotions, activities, life areas |
| **Talk About This** | Start a conversation about a specific entry |
| **Search & Filter** | Find entries by content, mood, or date |

---

## Talking to Your Guide (The Sprout)

### How Conversation Works

Your guide (The Sprout) doesn't just respond to your current message—it knows your whole story. Every conversation draws from:

- **Your journal entries** - Recent ones with full text
- **Your life context** - People, events, patterns from months of journaling
- **Your psychological patterns** - How you think, cope, and process
- **Your health data** - Sleep, activity, heart rate (if enabled)
- **Your preferences** - Communication style, what helps you most

### The Conversation Approach

Your guide follows a consistent approach:

1. **VALIDATE** - Acknowledge your feelings first
2. **EXPLORE** - Ask clarifying questions if needed
3. **SUPPORT** - Offer perspective or techniques
4. **EMPOWER** - End with something that builds your autonomy

### Different Modes

| Mode | Trigger | What Happens |
|------|---------|--------------|
| **Venting** | "I just need to vent" | Pure validation, no problem-solving |
| **Advice** | "What should I do?" | Explores options while encouraging your wisdom |
| **Processing** | Complex feelings | Gentle questions to help you understand |
| **Celebrating** | Sharing wins | Genuine celebration without overdoing it |

### What Your Guide Knows

Your guide has access to **all your data** with exact timestamps:

| Data Type | What It Knows | Example Questions |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Tracking Logs** | Every tap with exact counts | "How many times did I exercise this month?" |
| **Journal Entries** | Recent entries with full text | "What did I write about yesterday?" |
| **Lifestyle Factors** | Caffeine, sleep, outdoor time | "How much coffee have I had this week?" |
| **Health Data** | Heart rate, sleep, activity | "How did I sleep last night?" |
| **Life Context** | People, milestones, themes | "When did I start therapy?" |
| **Current Time** | Exact date and time | "How does today compare to last week?" |

### Crisis Handling

If you mention self-harm, suicide, or crisis:
1. Mood Leaf immediately provides crisis resources
2. **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline** (call or text)
3. **Crisis Text Line** (text HOME to 741741)
4. This happens BEFORE any AI processing

## Quick Logs (Twigs/Branches)

### What Are Twigs?

Twigs (also called Branches) are one-tap buttons for tracking anything:
- Habits you're building
- Habits you're breaking
- Medications
- Symptoms
- Goals
- Anything you want to count

### Branch Types

| Type | Example | Goal |
|------|---------|------|
| **Habit Build** | "Meditated" | Do MORE of this |
| **Habit Break** | "No alcohol" | Do LESS of this |
| **Medication** | "Morning meds" | Consistency |
| **Symptom** | "Anxious" | Awareness |
| **Goal** | "Applied for job" | Milestone |
| **Custom** | Anything | User-defined |

### What Your Guide Sees

For each twig, your guide sees:

```
🏃 Exercised:
    - Today: 2 times (at 7:30 AM, 5:15 PM)
    - This week: 8 times
    - This month: 25 times
    - All time: 47 times
    - Current streak: 5 days
    - Longest streak: 12 days
    - First logged: November 15, 2025
    - Last logged: Today at 5:15 PM
```

This means real answers based on your actual data.

### Why Branches Matter

Unlike leaves (which fall), branches stay and grow:
- **Streaks show growth** - But missing days don't "break" anything
- **No punishment** - The tree is still there even if you skip
- **Pattern visibility** - See what you're building over time

## Your AI Guide's Personalities

### Meet the 7 Personas

| Persona | Emoji | Style | Best For |
|---------|-------|-------|----------|
| **Clover** | 🍀 | Warm, casual, relatable | Everyday check-ins, friendly chat |
| **Spark** | ✨ | Energetic, motivating, uplifting | Celebrating wins, building momentum |
| **Willow** | 🌿 | Calm, wise, reflective | Deep exploration, gaining perspective |
| **Luna** | 🌙 | Mindful, grounding, present | Anxiety, overwhelm, finding calm |
| **Ridge** | ⛰️ | Focused, goal-oriented, practical | Problem-solving, making plans |
| **Flint** | 🔥 | Direct, honest, no-nonsense | When you need straight talk |
| **Fern** | 🌱 | Gentle, soft, nurturing | Sadness, grief, needing care |

### Choosing Your Persona

During onboarding, you pick a base persona. But your guide can adapt beyond that based on what you need.

### Customizing Your Guide

Go to **Settings** > **Coach Settings** for:
- **Choose Persona** - Switch your base guide
- **Custom Name** - Give your guide a name that feels right
- **Adaptive Mode** - Toggle automatic personality shifts
- **Detailed Settings:**
  - Energy level (Calm ↔ Energetic)
  - Directness (Gentle ↔ Direct)
  - Validation style (Heavy ↔ Light)
  - Response length (Brief ↔ Detailed)
  - Therapeutic approaches (CBT, Somatic, Mindfulness, etc.)

---

## How Your Guide Adapts

### Adaptive Mode

When Adaptive Mode is on, your guide automatically adjusts:

#### Mood-to-Persona Switches
- **Feeling anxious?** → Becomes more like Luna (calm, grounding)
- **Feeling sad?** → Becomes more like Fern (gentle, nurturing)
- **Feeling frustrated?** → Becomes more like Flint (direct, validating)
- **Feeling great?** → Becomes more like Spark (matching your energy)

These switches are **personalized to you** based on your onboarding answers.

#### Time-of-Day Energy
- **Morning**: Gentle, awakening energy
- **Afternoon**: Steady, supportive energy
- **Evening**: Softening, winding-down energy
- **Night**: Calm, soothing, preparing for rest

### Chronotype Awareness

Your guide respects your natural rhythm:

| If you're a... | Morning | Evening |
|----------------|---------|---------|
| **Early Bird** | Full energy, engaged | Winding down |
| **Normal** | Gentle awakening | Gradual softening |
| **Night Owl** | Low-key, no pressure | Still engaged |

A night owl journaling at 10pm won't get "time to sleep" pressure if that's their productive time.

### Jet Lag Support

After travel, your guide:
- Notices when your rhythm is off
- Adjusts expectations
- Offers tips for readjusting
- Doesn't pressure you when exhausted

## Life Context (The Tree)

### What is Life Context?

Life Context is Mood Leaf's memory of your story. It's built automatically from your journal entries and grows over time.

### What Gets Tracked

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **People** | Family, partners, friends, therapists, coworkers |
| **Events** | Achievements, losses, changes, milestones |
| **Health** | Conditions, medications, treatments |
| **Work** | Job, career events, colleagues |
| **Relationships** | Status, significant events |
| **Pets** | Names, species |
| **Activities** | Hobbies, interests |
| **Places** | Where you live, places mentioned |
| **Identity** | How you describe yourself |
| **Coping** | Healthy and unhealthy patterns |
| **Temporal** | "Sunday scaries", seasonal patterns |

### How It's Built

1. **Automatic extraction** - 600+ keyword patterns
2. **Entity detection** - Names, ages, locations, medications
3. **Pattern recognition** - Recurring themes over time
4. **Sentiment tracking** - How topics make you feel

### Viewing Your Tree

Go to **Settings** > **Life Context** to see:
- Key people and relationships
- Active topics and themes
- Recent milestones
- Detected patterns

### Correcting Information

Just tell your guide:
> "Actually, Sarah is my therapist, not my friend"
> "I'm not married anymore, we divorced"

The context updates based on new information.

## Health Integration (Weather)

### Why Connect Health Data?

Your body often knows before your mind does. Heart rate spikes, poor sleep, and low activity all affect how you feel. Connecting HealthKit lets your guide:

- Notice when your heart rate spikes (stress indicator)
- Acknowledge poor sleep might affect your mood
- Point out patterns ("you feel better on active days")
- Send gentle check-ins when your body signals stress

### Available Health Data

| Data Type | What's Tracked | How It Helps |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|
| **Heart Rate** | Current, resting, spikes | Detects stress before you notice |
| **HRV** | Heart rate variability | Measures nervous system stress |
| **Sleep** | Duration, quality, awakenings | Correlates with mood |
| **Activity** | Steps, exercise minutes | Connects movement to wellbeing |

### Heart Rate Spike Detection

When your heart rate spikes significantly:
1. Your phone buzzes with a gentle notification
2. "Your heart rate is up. What's going on?"
3. Tap to journal about it
4. Connect physical sensations to emotions

Notifications are rate-limited (max 1 per 30 minutes).

### Sleep-Mood Correlation

Over 90 days, Mood Leaf tracks:
- Your mood scores on good sleep nights
- Your mood scores on poor sleep nights
- Whether YOU specifically feel better with more sleep

**Example insight:**
> "Looking at your data, you consistently feel better on days after 7+ hours of sleep."

### Activity Correlation

Similarly tracks:
- Mood on active days vs. sedentary days
- Whether movement improves YOUR wellbeing

### How Patterns Help

Your guide uses these patterns to:
- Respond appropriately to YOUR thinking style
- Calibrate support vs. practical advice
- Adjust energy and pacing
- Align with your values

**We never diagnose.** We use patterns to communicate better.

### Insight Types

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| **Heart Rate Check-in** | "Your heart rate is elevated. Want to share what's going on?" |
| **Sleep Acknowledgment** | "Rough night? Only 5 hours. Be gentle with yourself today." |
| **Activity Suggestion** | "You've been still today. A short walk might help shift things." |
| **Pattern Discovery** | "You tend to feel better on days after good sleep." |
| **Correlation Insight** | "On days you walk more, your journal entries tend to be more positive." |
