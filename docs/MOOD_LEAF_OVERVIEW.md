## Welcome to Mood Leaf

Mood Leaf is a mental health journaling app with an AI companion that truly remembers you.

**What makes Mood Leaf different?**
- Your AI companion remembers your story over months and years
- It connects your mood to your sleep, activity, and life events
- It adapts its personality to what you need in the moment
- It's designed to help you NOT need it over time
- All your data stays on your device—we can't see it

## Core Philosophy

### The Mood Leaf Ethics

Mood Leaf follows strict ethical principles that guide everything we do:

#### 1. Never Diagnose
We will **never** label you with mental health conditions. Instead of "you have anxiety disorder," we say "you've been mentioning feeling anxious lately." Only qualified professionals can diagnose—we're not that.

#### 2. Never Prescribe
We will **never** tell you to start, stop, or change medications. Those decisions are between you and your doctor.

#### 3. Always Tentative
We use language like "it seems," "I wonder if," and "you might notice" because only YOU truly know your experience. We never tell you how you feel.

#### 4. Anti-Dependency
Mood Leaf is designed to help you **not need it**. We actively encourage:
- Real-world connections over app conversations
- Building your own coping skills
- Trusting your own wisdom
- Stepping away when appropriate

Our success is when you say "I don't need this app anymore."

#### 5. Privacy First
Everything stays on your device. We have no servers. We literally cannot see your data.

#### 6. Encourage Professional Help
For persistent struggles, we always encourage seeking professional support. We're a companion, not a replacement for therapy.

## Journaling (Leaves)

### The Leaf Philosophy

In Mood Leaf, journal entries are called **Leaves**. Like leaves on a tree, they're meant to be released—noticed, acknowledged, and let go.

**Journaling is noticing, not archiving.**

A leaf is a single thought, word, or feeling:
- Short, not long
- Released, not saved
- Let go, not held onto

This protects you from the trap of endless reviewing and rumination.

### Creating Entries

#### Text Entry
1. Tap the **+** button on the home screen
2. Write your thoughts
3. Tap **Save**

#### Voice Entry
1. Tap the **+** button
2. Tap the **microphone icon**
3. Speak your entry
4. Review and edit if needed
5. Tap **Save**

### What Happens When You Save

When you save a leaf, Mood Leaf automatically:
- **Detects mood** - Positive, negative, or neutral with intensity
- **Extracts topics** - People, events, themes you mentioned
- **Updates your Tree** - Adds to your life context for better conversations
- **Finds significance** - Marks important entries that contain life context

### Entry Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Mood Detection** | Color-coded (green = positive, red = negative, gray = neutral) |
| **Topic Tags** | People, emotions, activities, life areas |
| **Talk About This** | Start a conversation about a specific entry |
| **Search & Filter** | Find entries by content, mood, or date |

---

## Talking to Your Guide (The Sprout)

### How Conversation Works

Your guide (The Sprout) doesn't just respond to your current message—it knows your whole story. Every conversation draws from:

- **Your journal entries** - Recent ones with full text
- **Your life context** - People, events, patterns from months of journaling
- **Your psychological patterns** - How you think, cope, and process
- **Your health data** - Sleep, activity, heart rate (if enabled)
- **Your preferences** - Communication style, what helps you most

### The Conversation Approach

Your guide follows a consistent approach:

1. **VALIDATE** - Acknowledge your feelings first
2. **EXPLORE** - Ask clarifying questions if needed
3. **SUPPORT** - Offer perspective or techniques
4. **EMPOWER** - End with something that builds your autonomy

### Different Modes

| Mode | Trigger | What Happens |
|------|---------|--------------|
| **Venting** | "I just need to vent" | Pure validation, no problem-solving |
| **Advice** | "What should I do?" | Explores options while encouraging your wisdom |
| **Processing** | Complex feelings | Gentle questions to help you understand |
| **Celebrating** | Sharing wins | Genuine celebration without overdoing it |

### What Your Guide Knows

Your guide has access to **all your data** with exact timestamps:

| Data Type | What It Knows | Example Questions |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Tracking Logs** | Every tap with exact counts | "How many times did I exercise this month?" |
| **Journal Entries** | Recent entries with full text | "What did I write about yesterday?" |
| **Lifestyle Factors** | Caffeine, sleep, outdoor time | "How much coffee have I had this week?" |
| **Health Data** | Heart rate, sleep, activity | "How did I sleep last night?" |
| **Life Context** | People, milestones, themes | "When did I start therapy?" |
| **Current Time** | Exact date and time | "How does today compare to last week?" |

### Crisis Handling

If you mention self-harm, suicide, or crisis:
1. Mood Leaf immediately provides crisis resources
2. **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline** (call or text)
3. **Crisis Text Line** (text HOME to 741741)
4. This happens BEFORE any AI processing

---

## Quick Logs (Twigs/Branches)

### What Are Twigs?

Twigs (also called Branches) are one-tap buttons for tracking anything:
- Habits you're building
- Habits you're breaking
- Medications
- Symptoms
- Goals
- Anything you want to count

### Branch Types

| Type | Example | Goal |
|------|---------|------|
| **Habit Build** | "Meditated" | Do MORE of this |
| **Habit Break** | "No alcohol" | Do LESS of this |
| **Medication** | "Morning meds" | Consistency |
| **Symptom** | "Anxious" | Awareness |
| **Goal** | "Applied for job" | Milestone |
| **Custom** | Anything | User-defined |

### What Your Guide Sees

For each twig, your guide sees:

```
🏃 Exercised:
    - Today: 2 times (at 7:30 AM, 5:15 PM)
    - This week: 8 times
    - This month: 25 times
    - All time: 47 times
    - Current streak: 5 days
    - Longest streak: 12 days
    - First logged: November 15, 2025
    - Last logged: Today at 5:15 PM
```

This means real answers based on your actual data.

### Why Branches Matter

Unlike leaves (which fall), branches stay and grow:
- **Streaks show growth** - But missing days don't "break" anything
- **No punishment** - The tree is still there even if you skip
- **Pattern visibility** - See what you're building over time

## Your AI Guide's Personalities

### Meet the 7 Personas

| Persona | Emoji | Style | Best For |
|---------|-------|-------|----------|
| **Clover** | 🍀 | Warm, casual, relatable | Everyday check-ins, friendly chat |
| **Spark** | ✨ | Energetic, motivating, uplifting | Celebrating wins, building momentum |
| **Willow** | 🌿 | Calm, wise, reflective | Deep exploration, gaining perspective |
| **Luna** | 🌙 | Mindful, grounding, present | Anxiety, overwhelm, finding calm |
| **Ridge** | ⛰️ | Focused, goal-oriented, practical | Problem-solving, making plans |
| **Flint** | 🔥 | Direct, honest, no-nonsense | When you need straight talk |
| **Fern** | 🌱 | Gentle, soft, nurturing | Sadness, grief, needing care |

### Choosing Your Persona

During onboarding, you pick a base persona. But your guide can adapt beyond that based on what you need.

### Customizing Your Guide

Go to **Settings** > **Coach Settings** for:
- **Choose Persona** - Switch your base guide
- **Custom Name** - Give your guide a name that feels right
- **Adaptive Mode** - Toggle automatic personality shifts
- **Detailed Settings:**
  - Energy level (Calm ↔ Energetic)
  - Directness (Gentle ↔ Direct)
  - Validation style (Heavy ↔ Light)
  - Response length (Brief ↔ Detailed)
  - Therapeutic approaches (CBT, Somatic, Mindfulness, etc.)

---

## How Your Guide Adapts

### Adaptive Mode (Always On)

Your guide continuously adapts to you. This isn't a setting you toggle—**Adaptive Mode is always on**, constantly learning and adjusting:

#### Mood-to-Persona Switches
- **Feeling anxious?** → Becomes more like Luna (calm, grounding)
- **Feeling sad?** → Becomes more like Fern (gentle, nurturing)
- **Feeling frustrated?** → Becomes more like Flint (direct, validating)
- **Feeling great?** → Becomes more like Spark (matching your energy)

These switches are **personalized to you** based on your onboarding answers.

#### Time-of-Day Energy
- **Morning**: Gentle, awakening energy
- **Afternoon**: Steady, supportive energy
- **Evening**: Softening, winding-down energy
- **Night**: Calm, soothing, preparing for rest

### Chronotype Awareness

Your guide respects your natural rhythm:

| If you're a... | Morning | Evening |
|----------------|---------|---------|
| **Early Bird** | Full energy, engaged | Winding down |
| **Normal** | Gentle awakening | Gradual softening |
| **Night Owl** | Low-key, no pressure | Still engaged |

A night owl journaling at 10pm won't get "time to sleep" pressure if that's their productive time.

### Jet Lag Support

After travel, your guide:
- Notices when your rhythm is off
- Adjusts expectations
- Offers tips for readjusting
- Doesn't pressure you when exhausted

### The Whole App Adapts

It's not just your guide that adapts—**every part of Mood Leaf evolves with you**:

| Feature | How It Adapts |
|---------|---------------|
| **Your Guide** | Personality shifts based on mood, time, and what's helped before |
| **Sparks** | Mood-matched prompts based on what you're feeling right now |
| **Fireflies** | AI regenerates wisdom using your latest journal patterns, health data, and life context |
| **Life Context** | Grows automatically as you journal, building richer understanding |
| **Psych Profile** | Updates based on new patterns in your thinking and coping |
| **Health Insights** | Correlations improve with more data (90-day rolling analysis) |

**The longer you use Mood Leaf, the more it knows you.** But this isn't surveillance—it's support. Your context is compressed, not hoarded. Patterns are remembered, not raw data.

---

## Life Context (The Tree)

### What is Life Context?

Life Context is Mood Leaf's memory of your story. It's built automatically from your journal entries and grows over time.

### What Gets Tracked

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **People** | Family, partners, friends, therapists, coworkers |
| **Events** | Achievements, losses, changes, milestones |
| **Health** | Conditions, medications, treatments |
| **Work** | Job, career events, colleagues |
| **Relationships** | Status, significant events |
| **Pets** | Names, species |
| **Activities** | Hobbies, interests |
| **Places** | Where you live, places mentioned |
| **Identity** | How you describe yourself |
| **Coping** | Healthy and unhealthy patterns |
| **Temporal** | "Sunday scaries", seasonal patterns |

### How It's Built

1. **Automatic extraction** - 600+ keyword patterns
2. **Entity detection** - Names, ages, locations, medications
3. **Pattern recognition** - Recurring themes over time
4. **Sentiment tracking** - How topics make you feel

### Viewing Your Tree

Go to **Settings** > **Life Context** to see:
- Key people and relationships
- Active topics and themes
- Recent milestones
- Detected patterns

### Correcting Information

Just tell your guide:
> "Actually, Sarah is my therapist, not my friend"
> "I'm not married anymore, we divorced"

The context updates based on new information.

## Health Integration (Weather)

### Why Connect Health Data?

Your body often knows before your mind does. Heart rate spikes, poor sleep, and low activity all affect how you feel. Connecting HealthKit lets your guide:

- Notice when your heart rate spikes (stress indicator)
- Acknowledge poor sleep might affect your mood
- Point out patterns ("you feel better on active days")
- Send gentle check-ins when your body signals stress

### Available Health Data

| Data Type | What's Tracked | How It Helps |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|
| **Heart Rate** | Current, resting, spikes | Detects stress before you notice |
| **HRV** | Heart rate variability | Measures nervous system stress |
| **Sleep** | Duration, quality, awakenings | Correlates with mood |
| **Activity** | Steps, exercise minutes | Connects movement to wellbeing |

### Heart Rate Spike Detection

When your heart rate spikes significantly:
1. Your phone buzzes with a gentle notification
2. "Your heart rate is up. What's going on?"
3. Tap to journal about it
4. Connect physical sensations to emotions

Notifications are rate-limited (max 1 per 30 minutes).

### Sleep-Mood Correlation

Over 90 days, Mood Leaf tracks:
- Your mood scores on good sleep nights
- Your mood scores on poor sleep nights
- Whether YOU specifically feel better with more sleep

**Example insight:**
> "Looking at your data, you consistently feel better on days after 7+ hours of sleep."

### Activity Correlation

Similarly tracks:
- Mood on active days vs. sedentary days
- Whether movement improves YOUR wellbeing

---

## Calendar Integration

### Why Connect Your Calendar?

Your schedule affects your mental state. A packed week feels different than an open one. An important interview tomorrow creates different anxiety than a free weekend. Connecting your iOS Calendar lets your guide:

- Know what's coming up ("I see you have that presentation tomorrow")
- Acknowledge busy periods ("You have a packed week - be gentle with yourself")
- Prepare for important events ("Want to talk through your interview prep?")
- Detect travel and anticipate jet lag
- Understand context without you having to explain

### What Your Guide Sees

| Data Type | What's Tracked | How It Helps |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|
| **Today's Events** | Meetings, appointments, deadlines | Understands your immediate context |
| **Week Overview** | Schedule density and busyness | Calibrates expectations |
| **Travel Events** | Flights, trips, timezone changes | Anticipates jet lag and disruption |
| **Important Events** | Interviews, doctor visits, deadlines | Offers relevant support |

### Travel & Jet Lag Awareness

When your calendar shows travel:
- Your guide notices potential timezone changes
- Adjusts expectations during recovery
- Connects with chronotype awareness
- Doesn't pressure you when you're adjusting

**Example:**
> "I see you have a flight to London next week. That's a big timezone shift - want to plan how you'll manage the adjustment?"

### Busy Week Support

When your week is packed:
- Your guide acknowledges the pressure
- Suggests smaller, manageable actions
- Doesn't add to your mental load
- Celebrates when you make it through

**Example:**
> "You have 12 events this week - that's a lot. What's the one thing that would help you most right now?"

### How to Enable

1. Go to **Settings** > **Calendar**
2. Tap **Enable Calendar Access**
3. Allow Mood Leaf to read your calendar
4. Your guide now sees your schedule

### Privacy Note

- Only event titles, times, and locations are read
- Data stays on your device
- We never see or store your calendar
- You can disable anytime

---

## Patterns & Insights

### What Mood Leaf Tracks

| Pattern Type | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Cognitive Patterns** | How you tend to think (catastrophizing, black-and-white thinking, etc.) |
| **Defense Mechanisms** | How you cope (humor, rationalization, etc.) |
| **Attachment Style** | How you relate to others |
| **Locus of Control** | Do you feel in control or controlled by external forces? |
| **Growth Mindset** | Fixed vs. growth orientation |
| **Core Values** | What matters most to you |
| **Nervous System** | Hyperarousal, hypoarousal, or regulated |

### How Patterns Help

Your guide uses these patterns to:
- Respond appropriately to YOUR thinking style
- Calibrate support vs. practical advice
- Adjust energy and pacing
- Align with your values

**We never diagnose.** We use patterns to communicate better.

### Insight Types

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| **Heart Rate Check-in** | "Your heart rate is elevated. Want to share what's going on?" |
| **Sleep Acknowledgment** | "Rough night? Only 5 hours. Be gentle with yourself today." |
| **Activity Suggestion** | "You've been still today. A short walk might help shift things." |
| **Pattern Discovery** | "You tend to feel better on days after good sleep." |
| **Correlation Insight** | "On days you walk more, your journal entries tend to be more positive." |

## Sparks (Creative Prompts)

### What Are Sparks?

Sparks are creative prompts designed to shift your thinking when you're stuck. Inspired by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt's Oblique Strategies cards, these unexpected nudges jar you loose and create movement.

**Spark = Creativity & Play** — short, punchy prompts that reframe your situation.

### Sparks vs Fireflies: Universal vs Personal

| | **Sparks** | **Fireflies** |
|--|------------|---------------|
| **Type** | Universal wisdom | Personal wisdom |
| **Written for** | Everyone | Just you |
| **Content** | Pre-written, curated library | AI-generated fresh each time |
| **References** | Universal human experience | Your mom, your job, your patterns |
| **Changes when** | Your mood changes | Your life changes |
| **Analogy** | Book of quotes (timeless, you find the right one) | Friend's note (written knowing your situation) |

**Sparks are universal wisdom, smartly delivered.** The 210+ prompts work for anyone—they're timeless truths about being human. The app just shows you the right one at the right time based on your mood.

**Fireflies are personal wisdom, custom written.** Each one is generated specifically about YOUR life—mentioning your people, your patterns, your struggles. No one else gets the same Firefly you do.

### Categories (210+ Prompts)

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Depression** | Gentle nudges when everything feels heavy |
| **Anxiety** | Grounding prompts when your mind is racing |
| **Walking** | Contemplations for when you're in motion |
| **For Artists** | Creative unblocking for visual creators |
| **For Musicians** | Prompts for sonic exploration |
| **Funny** | Absurdist humor to break the spell |
| **Strange** | Weird perspectives to jar you loose |
| **Random** | Pull from any category |

### Examples

**Depression:**
> "What would you do if you felt 10% better? Do that thing anyway."
> "Your brain is lying to you. It's very convincing, but it's still lying."

**Anxiety:**
> "Name five things you can see. You're here, not there."
> "Your nervous system is trying to protect you. Thank it, then correct it."

**Walking:**
> "Walk as if you're not trying to get anywhere."
> "Find something beautiful that no one else has noticed today."

**Funny:**
> "Have you tried being a completely different person?"
> "What would a golden retriever do? Honestly, try that."

### Features

- **Favorites** - Save sparks that resonate with you
- **History** - Track what you've viewed
- **Mood-Based Selection** - Sparks adapt to your current emotional state
- **Search** - Find specific sparks by keyword

### How Sparks Adapt

When your journal reveals a mood, Sparks respond:
- **Feeling depressed or low?** → Depression category sparks surface
- **Anxious or worried?** → Anxiety grounding prompts appear
- **Feeling stuck creatively?** → Artist prompts emerge
- **Neutral or unknown?** → Funny or strange prompts to shift perspective

Your favorites and history also inform what appears—the system learns what resonates with you.

### How to Use

1. Go to **Sparks** in the app
2. Choose a category or tap **Random**
3. Sit with it—don't dismiss too quickly
4. Save to favorites if it resonates

---

## Fireflies (Personalized Wisdom)

### What Are Fireflies?

Fireflies are AI-generated wisdom cards personalized to YOU. Unlike Sparks (which are pre-written), Fireflies are created by AI using your full context—journal entries, moods, psychological patterns, life context, and health data.

**Fireflies = Wisdom & Support** — deeper, more personal prompts that know your story.

### Preset Categories

| Category | What It Offers |
|----------|----------------|
| **Anxiety** | Personalized grounding techniques |
| **Movement** | Motivations tailored to your patterns |
| **Creativity** | Unblocking based on your creative interests |
| **Music** | Prompts for your musical practice |
| **Breath** | Breathing exercises matched to your needs |
| **Connection** | Relationship-aware social encouragement |
| **Perspective** | Reframes based on your thinking patterns |
| **Sleep** | Rest prompts informed by your health data |

### Custom Categories

You can create your own Firefly categories:
1. Name the category (e.g., "Work Stress", "Parenting")
2. Add an emoji
3. AI generates 10 personalized wisdoms using your full context
4. Regenerate anytime for fresh content

### How Fireflies Know You (And Evolve With You)

Fireflies aren't static—**they regenerate based on your evolving story**. When generating wisdom, they draw from:

- **Journal patterns** - Themes, topics, and moods from your entries
- **Life context** - People, events, relationships you've mentioned
- **Psychological profile** - Your thinking patterns and coping styles
- **Health data** - Sleep quality, activity levels, heart rate patterns
- **Chronotype** - Your natural rhythm and time of day
- **Tracking habits** - What you're monitoring with twigs
- **Time context** - Morning vs. evening wisdom differs

**As your life changes, Fireflies change with you.** Started a new job? Fireflies will acknowledge it. Going through a breakup? Fireflies will offer relevant support. The AI doesn't just remember—it adapts.

### Examples

**For someone who journals about work stress and has poor sleep:**
> "You mentioned the project deadline. When you got through the last one, you took small breaks. What's a small break look like today?"

**For someone with high anxiety and a morning chronotype:**
> "The morning is when you have the most capacity. Is there one anxious thought you could examine while you have the energy?"

### How to Use

1. Go to **Fireflies** in the app
2. Enable the categories that matter to you
3. Create custom categories for specific needs
4. Tap a category to see your personalized wisdoms
5. Regenerate when you want fresh perspective
