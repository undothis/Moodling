# Mood Leaf Project Handoff

**Date:** January 21, 2026
**Branch:** `claude/resume-after-corruption-USBHf`

---

## 1. PROJECT INTENT (WHY THIS EXISTS)

Mood Leaf is a mental health journaling app that uses AI to provide personalized, empathetic coaching while helping users track patterns in their emotions, habits, and life events. Success means users feel genuinely heard and understood—not like they're talking to a generic chatbot. The AI must always reference specific user data (journals, twigs, life context) to demonstrate active listening. Safety is paramount: no diagnoses, no sad emojis, no negative framing, and crisis detection with appropriate resources.

---

## 2. CURRENT STATE (WHERE WE ARE)

**Overall Status:** Implementation / Refinement

The core app is functional with:
- Journaling with sentiment analysis
- Quick logs ("Twigs") for habit tracking
- AI coaching with multiple personas (Clover, Spark, Willow, Luna, Ridge, Flint, Fern)
- Life context compression for long-term memory
- Psychological profile building
- Simulator Mode for AI verification testing

Currently refining the Simulator Mode to properly validate AI behavior.

---

## 3. WHAT IS WORKING (SUCCESS)

- **AI Coach System:** Multiple personas working with adaptive mode, chronotype awareness, and travel/jet lag support
- **Data Pipeline:** Journals, twigs, life context, psych profile, health data all flow to Claude's system prompt
- **Simulator Mode Toggle:** Persists correctly across navigation
- **Challenge Generator:** Creates prompts to test AI data referencing
- **Challenge Persistence:** Challenge state now saves when navigating away
- **Verification System:** Checks AI responses against actual user data (journals, life context, psych profile)
- **Mental Health Safety:** No sad emojis, positive framing, crisis detection
- **Explicit Data Referencing Instructions:** Added to AI coach prompt to ensure specific, not generic responses
- **Exact Twig Timestamps:** AI now receives exact times for today's/yesterday's twig entries (e.g., "5:11 PM")

---

## 4. WHAT IS NOT WORKING / OPEN ISSUES (FAILURES)

- **Strange characters in chat responses:** User reported odd characters at start of some responses (e.g., "\nd I'm so sorry"). May be clipboard/encoding issue or API response artifact. Needs investigation.
- **`[H]` placeholder appeared in chat:** Claude was inserting `[H]` as a name placeholder. FIXED - added explicit instructions to never use bracket placeholders.
- **Verification edge cases:** The generic detection (CHECK 7) was flagging responses as generic even when actual data references were found. FIXED but may need more tuning.
- **Twig time tracking:** AI couldn't answer "what did I log at 5:11 PM?" FIXED - now includes exact timestamps for today's and yesterday's entries.
- **UTC vs Local Timezone Bug:** Newly logged twigs weren't appearing in AI context. FIXED - timestamps were stored in UTC (ISO format) but filtered using local dates. Added `isoToLocalDate()` helper function to convert UTC timestamps to local dates before comparison. This affected `getTodayEntries`, `getEntriesForLog`, `getDetailedLogsContextForClaude`, and other date-filtering functions in `quickLogsService.ts`.

---

## 5. KEY ASSUMPTIONS (CALL THESE OUT)

- **User has data:** Simulator verification assumes user has journals, twigs, and life context stored. Empty data states may behave differently. (UNTESTED)
- **Claude follows instructions:** Assumes Claude will reliably follow the "CRITICAL - ALWAYS REFERENCE SPECIFIC DATA" instructions in system prompt
- **AsyncStorage reliability:** Assumes AsyncStorage works consistently across web and native platforms
- **Keyword matching accuracy:** Life context keyword extraction assumes significant words are >4 characters

---

## 6. CONSTRAINTS & NON-NEGOTIABLES

- **No diagnoses:** Never say "you have anxiety disorder" or similar clinical labels
- **No sad emojis:** Mental health safety - avoid reinforcing negative states
- **Wins-first framing:** Always lead with positives, never shame or criticize
- **No placeholder names:** Never use `[Name]`, `[H]`, `[User]` or any bracket notation
- **Crisis handling:** Immediate resources for suicidal/self-harm language (988, Crisis Text Line)
- **Privacy:** Derived insights only, no raw journal text exposed unnecessarily
- **User autonomy:** Encourage real-world connection, not AI dependency

---

## 7. DECISIONS MADE (DO NOT RE-LITIGATE WITHOUT CAUSE)

- **Haiku model for development:** Cost-effective testing, Sonnet for production
- **Nature-themed personas:** 7 distinct personalities users can choose or adapt
- **AsyncStorage for persistence:** Simple, cross-platform storage
- **Simulator Mode as verification tool:** Not user-facing feature, developer/testing tool
- **CHECK 7 logic:** Only flags generic if no actual data references found AND uses generic phrases
- **Challenge state persistence:** Saves to AsyncStorage with dedicated keys

---

---

## 8. NEXT STEPS (FOR NEXT SESSION)

1. **Test AI response quality:** Run multiple challenges and verify AI consistently references specific user data
2. **Investigate strange characters:** Check if issue persists after [H] fix, may need to examine API response handling
3. **Add user name support (optional):** Consider adding optional user name field so AI can address them personally
4. **Edge case testing:** Test Simulator Mode with empty data (no journals, no twigs, no life context)
5. **Verify challenge categories:** Test each challenge category (data_accuracy, cross_domain, long_term_correlation, mental_health_framing)
6. **Consider debouncing:** AI response persistence saves on every keystroke - may want to add debounce for performance

---

## 9. HANDOFF NOTES (CONTEXT FOR THE NEXT MIND)

- **Branch has been merged:** Combined `claude/review-mega-prompt-LmMqp` (had this template) with `claude/resume-after-corruption-USBHf` (had all simulator fixes). Kept simulator fixes, added template.
- **Key files modified:**
  - `moodling-app/app/simulator.tsx` - Challenge persistence, CHECK 7 fix, AI response handler
  - `moodling-app/services/claudeAPIService.ts` - Added "ADDRESSING THE USER" section to prevent [H] placeholders
  - `moodling-app/services/quickLogsService.ts` - Added `isoToLocalDate()` helper and fixed all date filtering to use local timezone instead of UTC
- **User cares deeply about:** AI feeling personal, not generic. Every response should demonstrate the AI "remembers" their specific situation.
- **Don't repeat:** The generic check issue where it flagged as generic even with data refs found
- **Testing flow:** Simulator > Generate Challenge > Copy to Chat > Paste AI response back > Verify
- **Timezone fix details:** The bug was that `new Date().toISOString()` stores in UTC, but we compared against local dates like `getToday()`. Example: 11 PM EST on Jan 21 → UTC is 4 AM Jan 22 → filtering for "Jan 21" (local) wouldn't match the "Jan 22" (UTC) timestamp.

---

## 10. SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR THE NEXT CHECKPOINT

- [ ] AI responses consistently reference specific user data (journals, life context, people, events)
- [ ] No more `[H]` or bracket placeholders appearing in chat
- [ ] Challenge state reliably persists across navigation
- [ ] Verification results are accurate (no contradictory positives + generic flags)
- [ ] All challenge categories produce meaningful tests
- [ ] Newly logged twigs immediately appear in AI context (timezone fix verified)

---

## QUICK STATUS SNAPSHOT

"All 12 AI context sources verified and documented. Coach personality system with 7 personas and adaptive mode confirmed working. UTC timezone bug fixed. The AI has access to: life context, psych profile, chronotype, calendar events, health data, correlations, twigs (with exact times), lifestyle factors, exposure progress, journals, and user preferences."

## 13. COLLECTION SYSTEM - D&D-Style Gamification (January 2026)

### Overview

A gamification layer that rewards users for naturally using the app. Think D&D character sheets meets collectible card games. The system tracks usage patterns and unlocks artifacts, titles, and card backs without any pressure mechanics.

### Design Philosophy

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **No punishment** | Progress bars never decrease |
| **No streaks** | Milestones count total, not consecutive |
| **No FOMO** | Nothing expires or disappears |
| **No comparisons** | Personal journey only |
| **Surprise rewards** | Random unlocks add joy without pressure |

### What Was Built

**New Service:** `services/collectionService.ts` (~800 lines)

**Core Types:**
```typescript
type CollectibleType = 'artifact' | 'title' | 'card_back' | 'skill' | 'coach_perk';
type Rarity = 'common' | 'uncommon' | 'rare' | 'legendary';
type SkillType = 'calm' | 'ground' | 'focus' | 'challenge' | 'connect' | 'restore';
type UnlockTriggerType = 'milestone' | 'usage_pattern' | 'exploration' | 'random' | 'time_based';
```

### Collectibles

**Artifacts (15+):**
- `calm_stone` — First breathing session (common)
- `breath_feather` — 10 breathing exercises (uncommon)
- `starlight_vial` — Practice at 3am (rare)
- `rainbow_prism` — Try all skill types (legendary)
- `dawn_crystal` — Practice before 6am (rare)
- `night_lantern` — 5 practices after midnight (rare)

**Titles (10+):**
- `breath_wanderer` — Practice breathing 5 times
- `grounding_guardian` — Master grounding exercises
- `night_owl` — Practice after midnight
- `dawn_keeper` — Practice before 6am
- `explorer` — Try 10 different activities

**Card Backs (5):**
- `mist` (Common) — Default starter
- `forest` (Uncommon) — Try 3 different skills
- `sunset` (Rare) — Reach 50 total activities
- `aurora` (Legendary) — Unlock 10 artifacts

### Unlock Triggers

The smart unlock engine evaluates user activity patterns:

```typescript
// Milestone - Activity thresholds
{ type: 'milestone', check: (s) => s.breathingCount >= 10 }

// Usage Pattern - User preferences
{ type: 'usage_pattern', check: (s) => s.favoriteActivity === 'breathing' }

// Exploration - Trying new things
{ type: 'exploration', check: (s) => s.uniqueActivitiesUsed.size >= 5 }

// Random - 5% chance per session
{ type: 'random', check: () => Math.random() < 0.05 }

// Time-based - When activities occur
{ type: 'time_based', check: (s) => s.nightOwlCount >= 3 }
```

### Usage Statistics Tracked

```typescript
interface UsageStats {
  breathingCount: number;
  groundingCount: number;
  journalCount: number;
  bodyScanCount: number;
  thoughtChallengeCount: number;
  gameCount: number;
  lessonCount: number;
  totalActivities: number;
  uniqueActivitiesUsed: Set<string>;
  nightOwlCount: number;      // After midnight
  earlyBirdCount: number;     // Before 6am
  personasUsed: Set<string>;
  favoriteActivity?: string;
  activityDistribution: Record<string, number>;
}
```

### Skills System Updates

Added D&D-style attributes to all skills and exercises in `skillsService.ts`:

```typescript
interface Skill {
  // ... existing fields
  skillType: SkillType;  // 'calm' | 'ground' | 'focus' | 'challenge' | 'connect' | 'restore'
  rarity: Rarity;        // 'common' | 'uncommon' | 'rare' | 'legendary'
  lore?: string;         // Flavor text for collection view
}
```

**Example:**
```typescript
{
  id: 'box_breathing',
  name: 'Box Breathing',
  skillType: 'calm',
  rarity: 'common',
  lore: 'Used by Navy SEALs to stay calm under pressure. Four equal counts, like the sides of a box.'
}
```

### New Slash Commands

Added to `slashCommandService.ts`:

| Command | Aliases | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `/collection` | `/artifacts`, `/inventory`, `/bag` | View unlocked collectibles |
| `/stats` | `/activity`, `/progress` | View usage patterns and stats |

### Integration Points

1. **After any skill/exercise/game completes:**
   ```typescript
   await recordActivity('breathing', 'box_breathing');
   const unlocks = await checkForUnlocks();
   if (unlocks.length > 0) showUnlockCelebration(unlocks);
   ```

2. **Chat commands show collection/stats:**
   ```typescript
   // /collection → formatCollectionForChat()
   // /stats → formatStatsForChat()
   ```

### Files Modified

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `services/collectionService.ts` | NEW - Full collection system |
| `services/skillsService.ts` | Added skillType, rarity, lore to all skills/exercises |
| `services/slashCommandService.ts` | Added /collection and /stats commands |
| `docs/USER_MANUAL.md` | Added Collection System section |
| `docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` | Added collectionService docs, Collection System section |

### Next Steps for Collection System

1. **Build Collection UI** - Visual card collection view
2. **Skill Preview Cards** - Tap to see D&D-style card with rarity, lore, type
3. **Unlock Celebrations** - Animated notifications for new unlocks
4. **Stats Dashboard** - Progress bars by skill type
5. **Coach Integration** - Coaches can reference collection progress
