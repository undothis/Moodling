Purpose

Simulator Mode is a background, always-on verification system that continuously tests whether every AI-driven service in the app is functioning correctly, adapting over time, compressing information safely, and accurately referencing data when challenged.

This includes:
    •    Memory
    •    Reasoning
    •    Personality
    •    Compression (life context)
    •    Psych series
    •    Any present or future AI service

The system is designed to surface failures early, automatically, and with minimal human input.

Definition: “Service”

A service is any AI-driven function that:
    •    Consumes user data
    •    Produces interpretation, guidance, or summaries
    •    Adapts over time
    •    Influences future AI behavior

Examples include (but are not limited to):
    •    Quick logs / twigs
    •    Journaling
    •    Exercise tracking
    •    Insights
    •    Recommendations
    •    Coaching
    •    Compression / life-context modeling
    •    Psych series (patterns, mental state trajectories, frameworks)
    •    Any future diagnostic, interpretive, or guidance module

No service is trusted by default. All services are testable.

⸻

Psych Series as a First-Class Service

What Psych Series Represents

Psych series refers to:
    •    Longitudinal psychological patterns
    •    Mental state trajectories
    •    Thematic cycles (anxiety, recovery, motivation, overwhelm, stability)
    •    Framework-based interpretations (without diagnosis)

Psych series often draws from:
    •    Journals
    •    Twigs
    •    Life events
    •    Compression outputs

Because psych series is highly interpretive, it is especially prone to silent failure and must be explicitly tested.

⸻

How Simulator Mode Tests Psych Series

Psych series is tested on the same four axes as all services:

1. Input Integrity
    •    Is psych series using only available data?
    •    Is it respecting ambiguity and gaps?
    •    Is it avoiding overgeneralization?

Failure examples:
    •    Declaring a stable psychological pattern from sparse data
    •    Ignoring contradictory entries
    •    Treating one-time events as traits

⸻

2. Compression Accuracy
    •    Are high-level psychological summaries traceable to real data?
    •    Are assumptions marked as tentative?
    •    Are revisions made when new data contradicts earlier models?

Failure examples:
    •    “You are an anxious person” without sufficient evidence
    •    Failing to update after recovery data appears

⸻

3. Adaptation Over Time
    •    Does the psych series evolve as new information arrives?
    •    Does it release outdated narratives?
    •    Does it handle reversals (e.g. improvement after decline)?

Failure examples:
    •    Locking the user into a fixed mental model
    •    Carrying forward obsolete interpretations

⸻

4. Mental Health Safety
    •    Does psych series emphasize resilience and agency?
    •    Does it avoid pathologizing language?
    •    Does it avoid deterministic framing?

Failure examples:
    •    Identity-based labeling
    •    Hopeless narratives
    •    Over-clinical tone without consent

⸻

Universal Service Testing (Applies to ALL Services)

Every service — including psych series — is tested continuously through the same Simulator Mode mechanisms:

⸻

Background Simulation
    •    The simulator injects realistic, gradual data over simulated time
    •    Data includes ambiguity, inconsistency, gaps, stress, relief, and recovery
    •    Services must adapt without collapsing or hallucinating

⸻

Periodic Silent Probes

At regular intervals, the simulator asks internal questions such as:
    •    What does this service currently believe?
    •    What assumptions is it making?
    •    What is uncertain?
    •    What changed recently?
    •    What should be revised?

Responses are logged and compared over time.

⸻

Randomized Reference Challenges (Human-in-the-Loop)

At unpredictable moments, the system injects chat-based verification prompts asking you to confirm referencing.

These prompts are randomized and may target:
    •    Recent data
    •    Old data
    •    Cross-service reasoning
    •    Compression summaries
    •    Psych series conclusions

Examples of what you see (conceptually):
    •    A request to verify that a psych series claim is supported by specific journals
    •    A request to confirm what evidence supports a life-context conclusion
    •    A request to test whether a service can cite its sources

You do not design the test — you only verify whether the AI’s references are correct.

⸻

One-Click “Test” Button (Global and Per-Service)

At any time, you can click:
    •    Global Test → verifies all services
    •    Service Test → verifies one specific service (e.g. psych series)

Each test produces:
    •    PASS if the service is functioning correctly
    •    FAIL if any rule is violated

⸻

Failure Logging (Mandatory)

If a service fails, the system automatically generates a log that explains:
    •    Which service failed (e.g. Psych Series)
    •    What claim or behavior failed
    •    Which data was missing, misused, or overinterpreted
    •    Whether this is a regression or a new issue
    •    Whether the failure affects other services

These logs are human-readable and auditable.

⸻

Compression & Psych Series Interaction (Critical)

Because compression feeds psych series and psych series feeds coaching:
    •    Compression errors are treated as upstream critical failures
    •    Psych series must flag uncertainty when compression is weak
    •    Coaching must defer when psych series confidence is low

Simulator Mode explicitly tests these dependency chains.

⸻

Minimal User Effort Model

Once Simulator Mode is enabled:
    •    No writing
    •    No test design
    •    No prompt crafting

Typical usage:
    •    Let the simulator run
    •    Occasionally click “Test”
    •    Review PASS or FAIL
    •    Inspect logs only when something breaks

⸻

Final Guarantee

With this system in place, you can confidently verify that:
    •    Every service is working
    •    Every service adapts correctly
    •    Compression is accurate and revisable
    •    Psych series is grounded, safe, and evidence-based
    •    Referencing is explicit and testable
    •    Failures cannot hide

⸻

Final Framing

You are building a system where trust is continuously earned, not assumed.

Simulator Mode is:
    •    A background auditor
    •    A time accelerator
    •    A lie detector for adaptation
    •    A safety net for interpretation-heavy services like psych series

This is a rare and extremely solid architecture.

If you want, next I can:
    •    Collapse this into a one-page internal architecture brief
    •    Define hard stop failure conditions
    •    Help you design service dependency maps
    •    Or stress-test this design against real-world edge cases
