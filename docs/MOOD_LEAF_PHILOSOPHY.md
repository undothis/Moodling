# 🌿 Mood Leaf — Product Philosophy

## Core Ethos

> **Mood Leaf helps you notice, release, build, and return to the world.**

---

## The Tree Metaphor

Mood Leaf is a living tree that grows with you:

| Element | Function | Old Name |
|---------|----------|----------|
| 🍃 **Leaves** | Journal entries - thoughts you release | Journal entries |
| 🌱 **The Sprout** | AI companion that listens and helps you grow | Chat / AI |
| 🌳 **The Tree** | Your accumulated context, patterns, growth | Life Context |
| 🌿 **Branches** | Habits and goals you're building | Quick Logs |
| 💨 **Wind** | Prompts that move you forward | Oblique Strategies |
| ☀️ **Weather** | Health data context (not judgment) | HealthKit |
| 🌍 **Roots** | Your values, identity, foundation | Deep context |

---

## 1. Leaves = Release

**Journaling is noticing, not archiving.**

A "leaf" is a single thought, word, or feeling:
- Short, not long
- Released, not saved
- Let go, not held onto

You don't keep your leaves. You let them fall.

### Why?

Traditional journaling can become:
- Rumination disguised as reflection
- Self-surveillance disguised as self-awareness
- Performance disguised as processing

Leaves protect users from the trap of endless reviewing.

### UX Implications

- No scrolling history by default
- No streaks or achievements for journaling
- Leaves visually "fall" after being written
- Option to retrieve, but not the default
- **"You've left it here."** — Confirmation after writing

---

## 2. The Sprout = Growth

**The AI companion that builds the tree with you.**

The Sprout:
- Receives your leaves
- Remembers your story (the Tree grows)
- Helps you see patterns
- Nudges you toward the world, not the app

The Sprout is warm, tentative, honest. It speaks in "I wonder if..." and "it seems like..." because only you know your experience.

### The Sprout's Personality

- Curious, not prescriptive
- Present, not pushy
- Encouraging independence, not dependency
- Honest, not toxic-positive

### The Sprout's Goal

**To become unnecessary.**

The Sprout celebrates when you:
- Notice patterns yourself
- Don't need to open the app
- Build real-world connections
- Trust your own wisdom

---

## 3. Branches = Building

**Habits and goals grow stronger over time.**

Unlike leaves (which fall), branches stay and grow:
- ✓ "Took meds"
- ✓ "Didn't smoke"
- ✓ "Walked today"
- ✓ "Called mom"

Branches are **Quick Logs** — customizable buttons for tracking anything.

### Types of Branches

| Type | Example | Goal |
|------|---------|------|
| Habit Build | "Meditated" | Do MORE of this |
| Habit Break | "No alcohol" | Do LESS of this |
| Medication | "Morning meds" | Consistency |
| Symptom | "Anxious" | Awareness |
| Goal | "Applied for job" | Milestone |
| Custom | Anything | User-defined |

### Why Branches Matter

The Tree metaphor makes habits visual:
- Branches get thicker with consistency
- Streaks = growth rings
- Missing days don't "break" the tree — it's still there

This removes the punishment psychology of streak-breaking.

---

## 4. Weather = Context, Not Judgment

**HealthKit adds weather, not verdicts.**

Health data (heart rate, sleep, activity) provides context:

✓ "On days you walk more, leaves tend to be shorter."
✗ "You are better when you walk."

✓ "Your heart rate has been elevated."
✗ "You're having a panic attack."

✓ "You got 5 hours of sleep."
✗ "You should sleep more."

### Weather, Not Optimization

We don't:
- Score or grade health
- Create dashboards that define you
- Apply optimization pressure

We do:
- Correlate patterns when helpful
- Acknowledge conditions ("rough night?")
- Let the Sprout notice connections

---

## 5. Wind = Movement

**Prompts that push you forward.**

Wind prompts (Oblique Strategies) appear when you're stuck:

- Depression: "What would you do if you felt 10% better? Do that anyway."
- Anxiety: "Name five things you can see. You're here, not there."
- Walking: "Find something beautiful no one else has noticed today."

Wind is unexpected. It jars you loose. It creates movement.

---

## 6. Adaptive Notifications

**Notifications designed to reduce app use.**

Traditional apps: More notifications = more engagement = success

Mood Leaf: Fewer notifications = more life = success

### Notification Philosophy

- Gentle, not urgent
- Optional, not default
- Designed to END use, not increase it

### Example Notifications

✓ "If you want, leave one leaf and go outside."
✓ "No need to open me today."
✓ "You're allowed to skip."

✗ "You haven't journaled today!"
✗ "Don't break your streak!"
✗ "Come back, we miss you!"

### Adaptive Behavior

Notifications adapt to help break habits or build them:
- Remind about meds at the right time
- Nudge walking on sedentary days
- Stay silent when you're doing fine

---

## 7. The Tree's Success = You Leaving

**This is literal, not metaphorical.**

Success metrics:
- Usage naturally tapers over time
- User feels they don't need the app
- Real-world connections increase
- Self-awareness becomes internal

### Visual Representation

Over time:
- The Sprout slowly walks off the icon
- The UI becomes quieter
- The Tree stands alone, strong

### The End State

```
Empty space
Calm
Life elsewhere
```

**Mood Leaf does not want to be needed.**

---

## 8. Code of Conduct

### Never Diagnose
The Sprout uses language like "you've been feeling anxious" not "you have anxiety disorder."

### Never Prescribe
Medication decisions are between you and your doctor.

### Always Tentative
"It seems like..." and "I wonder if..." because only YOU know.

### Privacy First
Everything stays on your device. We have no servers.

### Encourage Professional Help
For persistent struggles, we always point to real help.

### Honest & Grounded
No toxic positivity. We meet you where you are.

- 🍂 Autumn orange — Leaves falling (release)
- 🌱 Sprout green — The companion (new growth)
