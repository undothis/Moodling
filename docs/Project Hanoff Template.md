1. PROJECT INTENT (WHY THIS EXISTS)

One short paragraph answering:
    •    What problem this project is solving
    •    What “success” looks like at a high level
    •    What must not be compromised (e.g. safety, accuracy, trust)

This section should not change often.

2. CURRENT STATE (WHERE WE ARE)

Overall Status

Choose one:
    •    Discovery
    •    Design
    •    Prototype
    •    Validation
    •    Implementation
    •    Refinement
    •    Maintenance

Brief summary of what currently exists and is understood.

3. WHAT IS WORKING (SUCCESS)

List only confirmed wins:
    •    Decisions that are locked
    •    Concepts that are validated
    •    Systems that are clearly defined
    •    Constraints everyone agrees on

These should be treated as ground truth going forward unless explicitly revisited.

⸻

4. WHAT IS NOT WORKING / OPEN ISSUES (FAILURES)

List:
    •    Known gaps
    •    Unresolved questions
    •    Things that failed tests or assumptions
    •    Risks or weaknesses discovered

Be honest and explicit.
This is not a blame section — it’s a clarity section.

⸻

5. KEY ASSUMPTIONS (CALL THESE OUT)

List assumptions that the project is currently making, such as:
    •    User behavior assumptions
    •    Technical assumptions
    •    Data availability assumptions
    •    AI capability assumptions

Mark any that are untested or fragile.

⸻

6. CONSTRAINTS & NON-NEGOTIABLES

List hard boundaries, for example:
    •    No use of X
    •    Must remain language-only
    •    Must be explainable
    •    Must be safe for vulnerable users
    •    Must scale / must not scale

This protects the project from drift.

⸻

7. DECISIONS MADE (DO NOT RE-LITIGATE WITHOUT CAUSE)

Bullet list of decisions that are considered settled:
    •    Architecture choices
    •    Design philosophy
    •    Terminology
    •    Scope inclusions / exclusions

If something is reversible, say so.

⸻

8. NEXT STEPS (FOR NEXT SESSION)

Clear, actionable items:
    •    What should be done next
    •    What should be validated or built
    •    What questions must be answered
    •    What risks should be tested

Limit this to 3–7 items max.

⸻

9. HANDOFF NOTES (CONTEXT FOR THE NEXT MIND)

Anything the next session should know but doesn’t fit elsewhere:
    •    Tone expectations
    •    Things to avoid repeating
    •    Prior dead ends
    •    Sensitivities or priorities

This is the “don’t make me re-explain this” section.

⸻

10. SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR THE NEXT CHECKPOINT

Define how you’ll know the next session was successful:
    •    What should be clearer?
    •    What should be decided?
    •    What should exist that doesn’t yet?

This prevents endless iteration.

⸻

OPTIONAL: QUICK STATUS SNAPSHOT (ONE LINE)

Example:
“System design is conceptually complete; next session should focus on validating edge cases and preparing for implementation.”
