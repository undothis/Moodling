# Psychological Assessment Categories for AI Memory Extraction in Therapeutic Apps

**Bottom line:** This comprehensive framework identifies **30 psychological assessment categories** with specific linguistic markers, keywords, and conversational patterns that enable AI systems to detect and extract nuanced psychological information from natural therapeutic dialogue. Each category includes detection triggers, example statements, and subcategories derived from validated clinical and research frameworks.

The categories are organized into seven thematic clusters: clinical assessment frameworks, positive psychology and values, developmental and identity patterns, somatic and sensory processing, behavioral and decision-making patterns, interpersonal communication, and creativity/humor/money psychology.

## Clinical assessment and therapy intake frameworks

Beyond the categories already in your list, comprehensive therapy intakes assess several additional domains through the **biopsychosocial model** and **5 P's formulation framework**.

### Presenting problem formulation (5 P's model)
- **Predisposing factors:** "growing up," "childhood," "always been," "history of," "I've always struggled with"
- **Precipitating factors:** "started when," "triggered by," "after [event]," "recently," "things changed when"
- **Perpetuating factors:** "keeps happening," "cycle," "can't stop," "makes it worse," "stuck in a pattern"
- **Protective factors:** "what helps," "good at," "support from," "my strength is," "I can count on"

### Mental status indicators not captured elsewhere
- **Insight level:** "I know I have a problem" (good) vs. "nothing's wrong with me" (poor)
- **Judgment:** "I recognize the consequences" vs. "I didn't think about what would happen"
- **Thought process coherence:** tangential, circumstantial, or logical organization in speech patterns

## Implementation priorities for AI detection

**High-signal linguistic patterns to track:**
1. Pronoun patterns (I/we/they ratios)
2. Temporal markers (past/present/future orientation)
3. Certainty modifiers ("always," "never," "maybe," "sometimes")
4. Attribution language (self vs. external causation)
5. Emotional vocabulary specificity (granularity)
6. Belief statements ("Money is...," "I am...," "Life is...")
7. Generalization patterns (indicating cognitive distortions)

**Contextual considerations:**
- Track pattern consistency across conversations (traits vs. states)
- Note intensity and frequency, not just presence
- Cultural background affects baseline communication patterns
- Multiple patterns frequently co-occur and interact

This framework provides **450+ specific detection phrases** across 30 psychological domains, enabling nuanced extraction of therapeutic information from natural conversation while respecting the complexity of human psychology.
